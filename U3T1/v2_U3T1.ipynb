It highlights the sobering reality that, due largely to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, global \\nlife expectancy and healthy life expectancy have both \\nregressed to the level a decade ago, although the impact was unequal across regions and income groups. This regression and its associated inequality signal significant challenges to health systems, demanding urgent attention and action. \\nEven though their share of all deaths reduced during the \\npandemic, noncommunicable diseases remain the world’s leading causes of death. This holds true for every WHO region except the African Region, where communicable, \\nmaternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions are still responsible for over half of all deaths. Globally, the rate \\nof improvement in healthy life expectancy has slowed in recent years, reflecting the increasing burden of NCDs, and the need to strengthen health systems to improve quality of care and meet increasing demands.\\nAt the heart of this year’s report is a critical call to action \\nto accelerate progress towards the “triple billion” targets set out in WHO’s 13th General Programme of Work, and the Sustainable Development Goals on which they are \\nbased. Globally, 585  million more people are expected \\nto be covered by essential health services without catastrophic health spending by 2025 than in 2018 – just over halfway to the target of 1  billion – and 777  million \\nmore people are expected to be better protected from health emergencies. Healthier populations provide the \\nsole bright spot, where an estimated 1.5  billion more \\npeople will enjoy healthier lives by 2025. Overall, however, progress is insufficient to achieve the health-related SDG targets by 2030. \\nThese gaps reflect huge, missed opportunities in \\nimproving global health, and underscore the urgency for the global community to intensify efforts and investments in health. The 14th General Programme of Work aims to \\nbring together Member States, the WHO Secretariat and \\na broad coalition of partners around a shared strategy to promote, provide and protect health, and to realize WHO’s founding vision for the highest attainable standard \\nof health, as a fundamental right for all people.\\nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus\\nDirector-General\\nWorld Health Organization\\nv\\nAbbreviations\\nAAAA  Addis Ababa Action Agenda\\nABR  adolescent birth rates\\nAMR  antimicrobial resistance\\nAPC  alcohol per capita consumption\\nARR  average annual rate of reduction\\nART  antiretroviral therapy\\nASDR  age-standardized death rates\\nBMI  body mass index\\nCC Creative Commons\\nCDR  crude death rate\\nCOVID-19  coronavirus disease 2019\\nDMCF  Data management competency framework\\nDTP  diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (vaccine)\\nEU European Union\\nGPW13  Thirteenth General Programme of Work\\nGTS   Global technical strategy for \\nmalaria 2016–2030\\nHALE  healthy life expectancy\\nHEP  health emergencies protection\\nHIW  health information workers\\nHPOP  healthier populations\\nHPV  Human papillomavirus (vaccine)\\nIHR  International Health Regulations\\nIPV intimate partner violence\\nIQR  interquartile range\\nITN insecticide-treated mosquito net\\nMCV  measles-containing vaccine\\nMDG  Millennium Development Goal\\nMDS  Model Disability Survey\\nMMR  maternal mortality ratioMVIP  Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme\\nNCD  noncommunicable disease\\nNMR  neonatal mortality rate\\nNPA  National Prevention Agreement\\nNTDs  neglected tropical diseases\\nODA  official development assistance\\nOOP  out-of-pocket\\nOPRM  other pandemic-related mortality\\nPCV  pneumococcal conjugate vaccine\\nPHC  primary health care\\nPM particulate matter\\npolio  poliomyelitis\\nR21  R21-Matrix-M malaria vaccine\\nRMNCH   reproductive, maternal, newborn and \\nchild health\\nRTS,S  RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine\\nSDG  Sustainable Development Goal\\nSENADIS  National Disability Service (Chile)\\nSPAR   States Parties Self-Assessment \\nAnnual Report\\nTB tuberculosis\\nTDR   Special Programme for Research and \\nTraining in Tropical Diseases\\nTFA  trans-fatty acids\\nU5MR  under-five mortality rate\\nUHC  universal health coverage\\nUI uncertainty interval\\nWASH  water, sanitation and hygiene\\nWHA  World Health Assembly\\nWHO  World Health Organization\\nvi\\nIntroduction\\nThe World health statistics report is the annual \\ncompilation of health and health-related indicators, which has been published by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 2005. WHO’s Division of Data, Analytics and Delivery for Impact produces this report, \\nin collaboration with WHO technical departments and \\nregional and country offices. \\nThe 2024 edition reviews more than 50 health-related \\nindicators from the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and WHO’s Thirteenth General Programme of Work (GPW13). The report consists of four chapters, complemented by tables presenting the latest available data (https://www.who.int/data/gho/publications/world-\\nhealth-statistics). \\nChapter 1 presents updated global and regional \\nestimates of life expectancy, healthy life expectancy, \\nand mortality from specific causes, particularly the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on demographic and epidemiological profiles. Chapter 2 summarizes global and regional trends in the health-related SDGs. Chapter 3 presents the latest update on WHO’s Triple Billion target within the GPW13. And Chapter 4 looks at important global health issues, including the double burden of malnutrition, disability-related health inequities, and the \\nhealth of refugees and migrants. Country-focused stories \\nare presented throughout the report to highlight efforts undertaken to address various health issues.\\nThe information presented in World health statistics \\n2024 is based on data available from global monitoring \\nas of May 2024. The data reference years vary, however, as data series are updated on different timelines and with different lag between the data reference year and the publication year. Data have been compiled \\nprimarily from publications and databases produced \\nand managed by WHO or United Nations partner entities and supplemented with data and analyses from peer-reviewed publications.\\n1\\nKey messages\\nIn just two years, the COVID-19 pandemic reversed over \\na decade of gains in both life expectancy at birth and \\nhealthy life expectancy (HALE). By 2020, both global \\nlife expectancy and HALE had rolled back to 2016 levels \\n(72.5  years and 62.8 years, respectively). The following \\nyear saw further declines, with both retreating to 2012 levels (71.4 years and 61.9 years, respectively).\\nThe WHO regions most affected were the Region of the \\nAmericas and South-East Asia Region, with declines of \\nabout 3 years in life expectancy and 2.5 years in HALE \\nbetween 2019 and 2021. The Western Pacific Region saw \\nthe smallest impacts over the first two pandemic years, \\nwith losses of less than 0.1 and 0.2 years in life expectancy \\nand HALE, respectively.\\nGlobally, the share of deaths from noncommunicable \\ndiseases (NCDs) among all deaths rose steadily to 73.9% by 2019, while the share of communicable diseases \\ndropped to 18.2%. With the emergence of COVID-19, \\ncommunicable diseases surged back to 23.0% of all deaths in 2020 and 28.1% in 2021 – a return to 2005 levels. Consequently, the share of NCD deaths declined to 70.0% in 2020 and 65.3% in 2021.\\nCOVID-19 ranked among the top three leading causes \\nof death globally in 2020 and 2021, responsible for \\n4.1 million and 8.8 million lives lost, respectively. In \\nthe Region of the Americas it was the number one cause of death in both years, and ranked in the top five causes for all regions except for the African and Western Pacific regions.\\nAt the midway point for the SDGs, progress on  \\nhealth-related Goals has been mixed. Among the  \\n53 health-related indicators included in this report, \\n32 have numeric SDG or global targets. None of these \\nhave yet been achieved, and none are on track under current trends. However, most indicators (42) are showing \\nmovement in the right direction globally.\\nThe world is also off-track to achieve the universal health \\ncoverage (UHC), health emergencies preparedness and \\nhealthier populations “Triple Billion” targets by 2025. \\nFrom the 2018 baselines, 585  million more people are \\nexpected to have access to essential health services without incurring catastrophic health spending by \\n2025, well short of the one billion UHC target. For health \\nemergency preparedness, 777  million more people are \\nexpected to be protected by 2025, again short of the \\ntarget. Healthier populations is the sole area positioned \\nto meet its one billion target, with 1.5  billion additional \\npeople anticipated to be living healthier lives by 2025. But \\nacceleration across all three areas is needed to achieve \\nbroader health-related SDGs by 2030.\\nThe world continues to grapple with the double burden \\nof malnutrition, characterized by the coexistence of undernutrition and overweight/obesity. In 2022, \\nworldwide over one billion people aged 5  years and over \\nwere living with obesity, while over half a billion were \\nunderweight. In the same year, 148  million children \\nunder five were affected by stunting, 45  million suffered \\nfrom wasting and 37  million were living with overweight. \\nDouble-duty actions that efficiently and effectively address both facets of malnutrition are critical to make the most of limited resources.\\nThis report also highlights health challenges faced by \\npersons with disabilities, and refugees and migrants. \\nGlobally, in 2021, an estimated 1.3  billion people (16% of \\nthe population) had disability and faced health inequities due to avoidable, unfair and unjust factors. Progress \\nrequires strengthening health systems that integrate \\ntargeted actions to increase equity. \\nRefugees and migrants are not inherently less healthy \\nthan host populations, yet various suboptimal health \\ndeterminants – further exacerbated by linguistic, cultural, \\nlegal and other barriers – mean that they often experience significant health disparities. Access to health care is \\noften limited for refugees and migrants, with only half \\nof the 84 countries surveyed between 2018 and 2021 \\nproviding them access to government-funded health services on par with nationals. Lack of quality data further \\nobstructs understanding of their needs and tracking \\nprogress on health goals.\\nThe report serves as a crucial reminder that today’s \\nhealth systems must swiftly adapt to respond to changing \\ndemographics and persisting inequities.\\n3\\n1   \\nLife expectancy, \\nhealthy life expectancy and burden of disease in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc in population \\nhealth across the globe. The devastating impacts of the \\npandemic on health, economy, families and society have been \\nobserved worldwide since 2020 and are expected to continue \\nto unfold in the years to come. This chapter documents its \\ndetrimental impact on global population health and the \\ninequality of that impact, as reflected in life expectancy and \\nHALE, against the backdrop of the overall progress made in many aspects of population health before the pandemic.1.1 Life expectancy and healthy \\nlife expectancy\\n1  Unless otherwise noted, the statistics quoted in this report are presented with 95% uncertainty intervals.1.1.1  Global trend\\nSteady gain in global life expectancy at birth was \\nobserved from the turn of the millennium until the \\nonset of the COVID-19 pandemic, up from 66.8  years \\n(95% uncertainty interval1 [UI]: 66.2–67.3 years) in 2000 \\nto 73.1  (UI: 72.6–73.7) years in 2019, with men gaining \\n6.2 years from 64.4 (UI: 63.9–64.9)  years to 70.6 (UI70.1–71.2)  years and women gaining 6.5  years from 69.2 \\n(UI: 68.7–69.8)  years to 75.7 (UI: 75.3–76.2)  years during \\nthis period. In parallel, global HALE at birth increased \\nfrom 58.1 (UI: 57.4–58.9) years in 2000 to 63.5  (UI: 62.7–\\n64.3) years in 2019, with that for men increasing from 57.0 \\n(UI: 56.3–57.6) years to 62.3  (UI: 61.7–63.1) years and that \\nfor women increasing from 59.3 (UI: 58.6–60.2) years to \\n64.6  (UI: 63.8–65.5) years (Fig. 1.1) (1).\\nFigure 1.1  Global trends in life expectancy and HALE at birth, by sex, 2000–2021\\nLife expectancy at birth (years)\\nHealthy life expectancy at birth (years)\\nMale\\nFemale\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n2000\\n2010\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\nLife expectancy at birth (years)\\nSource : WHO (1).\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n6\\nHowever, the COVID-19 pandemic reversed this trend \\nand wiped out the progress that was made in nearly a decade within just two years. Global life expectancy at \\nbirth dropped by 0.7  years to 72.5 (UI: 71.9–73.1)  years in \\n2020 (back to the level of 2016), and by a further 1.1  years \\nto 71.4 (UI: 70.8–72.0)  years in 2021 (back to the level of \\n2012). Similarly, global HALE dropped to 62.8 (UI: 62.0–\\n63.7)  years in 2020 (back to the level of 2016) and 61.9  (UI: \\n61.1–62.8) years in 2021 (back to the level of 2012) (1).\\nThe life expectancy at birth for both men and women \\ndropped by about 1.7  years between 2019 and 2021. \\nHowever, the decline for men was relatively more evenly \\nsplit in 2020 (by 0.8  years) and 2021 (by 0.9  years), while \\nthe decline for women was concentrated more in 2021 \\n(by 1.3  years) than in 2020 (by 0.5  years). Similar disparity \\nbetween sexes was observed for HALE: HALE among \\nmen dropped by 0.7  years to 61.6 (UI: 60.9–62.4)  years in \\n2020 and another 0.8  years to 60.9 (UI: 60.1–61.6)  years in \\n2021, and HALE among women dropped by 0.5  years to \\n64.1 (UI: 63.2–65.0)  years in 2020 and 1.1  years to 63.0  (UI: \\n62.2–63.9) years in 2021 (1).1.1.2  Regional trends\\nPrior to the pandemic, life expectancy and HALE had \\nrisen across all WHO regions and World Bank country income groups between 2000 and 2019 (Figs 1.2 and 1.3). The greatest gains were seen in low-resources settings including the African Region (11.2-year gain in life \\nexpectancy and 9.8-year gain in HALE) and the South-East \\nAsia Region (7.3-year gain in life expectancy and 6.5-  y ear \\ngain in HALE); and in low-income countries (10.6-  y ear \\ngain in life expectancy and 9.3-year gain in HALE). \\nPopulations in high-income and upper-middle-income countries continue to live longer and healthier lives than those in low- and lower-middle-income countries. However, the pace of improvement in high-income \\ncountries has stagnated since 2010, with only a 1.1-year \\nincrease in life expectancy and a 0.6-year increase in HALE in 2010–2019, less than one third of the increases in  low-income countries over the same period (1).\\nFigure 1.2  Trends in life expectancy and HALE at birth, by sex and by WHO region, 2000–2021\\nEuropean Region\\nEastern Mediterranean Region\\nWestern Pacific Region\\nAfrican Region\\nRegion of the Americas\\nSouth-East Asia Region\\n2000\\n2010\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2000\\n2010\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2000\\n2010\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2000\\n2010\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2000\\n2010\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2000\\n2010\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\nLife expectancy at birth (years)\\nLife expectancy at birth (years)\\nHealthy life expectancy at birth (years)\\nMale\\nFemale\\nSource : WHO (1).\\nLife expectancy, healthy life expectancy and burden of disease in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic\\n7\\nFigure 1.3  Trends in life expectancy and HALE at birth, by sex and World Bank income group, 2000–2021\\nUpper-middle-income\\nHigh-income\\nLow-income\\nLower-middle-income\\n2000\\n2010\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2000\\n2010\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2000\\n2010\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2000\\n2010\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\nLife expectancy at birth (years)\\nLife expectancy at birth (years)\\nHealthy life expectancy at birth (years)\\nMale\\nFemale\\nSource : WHO (1).\\nIn addition, the impact of the pandemic was unequal \\nacross regions and income groups. The Region of the Americas and the South-East Asia Region have been the hardest hit: life expectancy in both regions dropped \\nby 3.0  years and HALE by 2.5  years between 2019 and \\n2021. The Western Pacific Region was the least affected during the first two years of the pandemic, with less than \\n0.1 years and 0.2  years of loss seen for life expectancy and \\nHALE, respectively. It was the only WHO region in which increases in life expectancy (0.2-year gain) and HALE  (0.1-year gain) were observed in 2020. However, the region experienced some losses (0.3 years in life expectancy and 0.3 years in HALE) in 2021 compared with \\n2020, that cancelled out the earlier gains (1).\\nThe scale of pandemic-related tolls also varied over \\ntime across regions. The Region of the Americas, the \\nEuropean Region and the Eastern Mediterranean Region all experienced more severe impact in the first pandemic year, with 2020 seeing at least two thirds of the life expectancy decline and three fifths of the HALE decline. In contrast, coinciding with the wider spread of the Delta variant, the decline in life expectancy and HALE in the African and South-East Asia regions occurred more \\npredominantly in 2021, accounting for at least 65% of the \\ntotal losses in 2019–2021 (Fig. 1.2) (1).\\nBy World Bank income groups, life expectancy was cut \\nby 0.6  years in low-income countries and by 2.4  years in \\nlower-middle-income countries, and HALE cut by 0.6  y ears \\nand 2.0  years, respectively, between 2019 and 2021. Over \\nhalf of the years lost in life expectancy and HALE in upper-\\nmiddle-income countries and over 70% of those in high-income countries in 2019–2021 occurred during the first year of the pandemic. In lower-middle-income countries, the hardest hit occurred in 2021, seeing over 70% of the \\nloss in life expectancy and HALE. In low-income countries, \\nthe worsening of longevity was rather minimal in 2020, \\nassociated with only 2% (0.01 of 0.55  years) of the decline \\nin life expectancy (Fig. 1.3) (1).\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n8\\n1.2 Shifting disease burden\\n1.2.1  Broad categories of \\ncauses of deaths\\nNot only has the pandemic set back healthy longevity \\nworldwide by years, it also reversed the previous trends of shifting disease burden to NCDs. Grouping deaths into three broad categories of causes of death – communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional \\nconditions (“communicable diseases” hereafter), NCDs, \\nand injuries – clear transition can be noticed well before the pandemic (1).Globally, NCDs accounted for 59.5% of all deaths in 2000, rising to 73.9% in 2019, while the share of communicable diseases dropped from 32.2% in 2000 to 18.2% in 2019, \\nand injuries remained relatively stable around 8%. As \\nCOVID-19 emerged as a new infectious disease and started to take a toll on human lives, the share of deaths due to communicable diseases jumped back to the 2012 level (23.0%) in 2020 and further back to the 2005 level (28.1%) in 2021. Simultaneously, the share of NCD deaths dropped to 69.9% in 2020 and to 65.3% in 2021, and the share of injury deaths dropped to just about 7% in both years (Fig. 1.4) (1).\\nFigure 1.4  Composition of causes of death, global, 2000–2021\\n0\\n25\\n50\\n75\\n100\\n2000\\n2005\\n2010\\n2015\\n2020\\nPercentage (%)\\nInjuries\\nCommunicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions\\nNoncommunicable diseases\\nNote: In countries that have low-quality vital registration, WHO’s current estimates include a cause of death category, “other pandemic-related mortality (OPRM)” , \\nwhich could include underlying causes of deaths from any of the three groups. The graph only shows the relative composition of the three groups; OPRM is not \\nincluded.  \\nSource: WHO (1).\\n9\\nLife expectancy, healthy life expectancy and burden of diseaseAmong WHO regions, the African Region still had \\nthe largest share (54.9%) of deaths attributable to communicable diseases before the pandemic, with NCDs accounting for only about 36% of all deaths in 2019. These levels remained largely stable in 2020 and 2021, \\nindicating little impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on \\nthe broad distribution of causes of death. Similarly, the Western Pacific Region has seen limited change since 2019 in the distribution across the three categories, with NCDs accounting for about 88% and communicable diseases for about 6% of all deaths (Fig. 1.5) (1).\\nHowever, the pandemic has been more disruptive to the \\nexpected trajectories in other WHO regions. The European Region, which had the highest share of NCD deaths among all deaths in 2019 (89.6%), experienced an abrupt shift of disease burden back to communicable diseases \\nin 2020 and 2021, as the share of NCD deaths dropped to 75.9% in 2021 and the share of communicable diseases \\nnearly quadrupled from 5.3% in 2019 to 20.0% in 2021. Other WHO regions also experienced sizable, reversed shift of disease burden from NCDs and injuries back to communicable diseases, leading to increases in its share \\nranging from about 10% (Eastern Mediterranean Region) \\nto 18% (South-East Asia Region) (1).\\nSimilar disparity was also observed across World Bank \\nincome groups (Fig. 1.6). Bearing the largest share (nearly 50%) of deaths due to communicable diseases, low-income countries saw minimal change in the distribution of deaths from the three broad groups between 2019 and 2021. In contrast, NCDs in upper-middle-income and high-income countries were responsible for the largest share of deaths at 84.8% and 88.1%, respectively, in 2019, but these figures dropped by 9.9% and 8.1% between 2019 \\nand 2021 (1).\\nFigure 1.5  Composition of causes of death, by WHO region, 2000–2021\\nEuropean Region\\nEastern Mediterranean Region\\nWestern Pacific Region\\nAfrican Region\\nRegion of the Americas\\nSouth-East Asia Region\\n2000\\n2005\\n2010\\n2015\\n2020\\n2000\\n2005\\n2010\\n2015\\n2020\\n2000\\n2005\\n2010\\n2015\\n2020\\n0\\n25\\n50\\n75\\n100\\n0\\n25\\n50\\n75\\n100\\nPercentage (%)\\nInjuries\\nCommunicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions\\nNoncommunicable diseases\\nNote: In countries that have low-quality vital registration, WHO’s current estimates include a cause of death category, “other pandemic-related mortality (OPRM)” , \\nwhich could include underlying causes of deaths from any of the three groups.

Examining age-standardized death rates (ASDR) exhibits more clearly the progress achieved prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the setback it \\ncaused. Globally, the ASDR from communicable diseases \\nwas cut by about half from 244.5 (UI: 155.3–373.9) to 119.3 \\n(UI: 72.8–189.1) per 100  000 population in 2000–2019. Yet, \\nthe pandemic brought back the rate to 160.4 (UI: 107.6–\\n237.8) per 100  000 in 2020 and 211.4 (UI: 150.1–300.7) per \\n100 000 in 2021, representing 34.5% and 77.2% increases \\nfrom the 2019 baseline. While the global improvement up to 2019 was primarily driven by the progress in the African Region (56.1% decline), South-East Asia Region (63.3% decline) and Eastern Mediterranean Region (47.4% decline), the Region of the Americas and the European \\nRegion were hardest hit by the pandemic in relative \\nterms, with ASDR from communicable diseases more than tripled (3.4 and 3.8 times, respectively) between 2019 and 2021. The South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions also saw ASDR from communicable diseases more than doubled in the same period. In comparison, the African and Western Pacific regions only experienced moderate increases (14.3% and 11.9% increase, respectively) (1).\\nProgress was also made in all WHO regions in 2000–2019 \\nfor mortality from NCDs (except for the South-East Asia Region) and mortality from injuries (except for the Eastern Mediterranean Region), leading to 18.8% reduction in ASDR from NCDs and 23.1% reduction in ASDR from injuries globally in 2000–2019. Limited impact was seen in ASDR from these two groups of cause of death \\nin 2019–2021 compared with that from communicable \\ndiseases (1).\\nSimilar trends were observed across all World Bank \\nincome groups, with sizable reductions observed in ASDR for all three broad cause categories in 2000–2019 and little excess change brought by the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 for NCDs and injuries. The COVID-19 pandemic reversed the declining trend in ASDR for communicable diseases in all income groups to the extent that the level in 2021 that was above the 2000 level in upper-income countries and nearly double the 2000 level in high-income \\ncountries; thus, undoing over two decades of work (1).\\n11\\nLife expectancy, healthy life expectancy and burden of disease1.2.2  Leading causes of death\\nLooking at the leading causes of death, there was also \\na clear transition from communicable causes to NCDs. Globally, five of the 10 leading causes in 2000 were communicable and four were NCDs, with road injury being the only injury cause (Fig. 1.7). In 2019, seven of the \\n10 leading causes were NCDs and the remaining three \\ncommunicable (1).\\nThe pace of transition was uneven across regions \\nand income groups. In 2019, communicable diseases continued to take up seven of the top 10 causes of deaths along with two NCDs and one injury in the African Region and low-income countries (1).\\nWith communicable diseases being effectively prevented \\nor treated, and populations surviving to older ages where NCDs become the predominant risk, NCDs already accounted for nine of the top 10 causes in 2019 in the European Region and the Western Pacific Region \\n(Fig.  1.8), as well as in upper-middle-income and high-\\nincome countries (Fig. 1.9). The only communicable disease that ranked among the top 10 in these regions or income groups were lower respiratory infections (1).\\nFigure 1.7  Top 10 causes of death globally in 2000, 2019, 2020 and 2021\\nDiarrhoeal diseases\\nHIV/AIDS\\nPreterm birth complications\\nRoad injury\\nIschaemic heart disease\\nCOVID-19\\nStroke\\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease\\nLower respiratory infections\\nTrachea, bronchus, lung cancers\\nAlzheimer disease and other dementias\\nDiabetes mellitus\\nKidney diseases\\nTuberculosis\\n>10\\n10\\n9\\n8\\n7\\n6\\n5\\n4\\n3\\n2\\n1\\n2000\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\nRank\\nCommunicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions\\nInjuries\\nNoncommunicable diseases\\nNote: Solid lines represent movement within the top 10 causes of death.

Maternal and child mortality reductionsThis distribution of the leading 10 causes of death by \\nbroad cause group at global level remained unchanged from 2019 in 2020 and 2021; however, COVID-19 emerged as the third and second leading causes, respectively, \\nclaiming 4.1  million and 8.8  million lives globally. In all \\nbut two WHO regions (the African and Western Pacific regions), COVID-19 ranked among the top five causes of deaths in 2020 and 2021, responsible for the largest number of deaths in both years in the Region of the Americas, in 2021 in the South-East Asia Region and the second largest number of deaths in both years in the European and the Eastern Mediterranean regions. In the \\nAfrican Region, the disease only moved up from 12th \\nto sixth in 2021. While in the Western Pacific Region it \\nremained out of the top 10, it rose from being 50th in 2020 to 19th in 2021 (1).\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n14\\nwere among the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \\nsteering the global efforts through to the year 2015. They remain among the global targets in the SDG period, \\nwhich runs from 2015 to 2030.\\nMaternal mortality \\nMarked reduction in maternal mortality was achieved \\nduring the MDG years between 2000 and 2015. The global \\nmaternal mortality ratio (MMR) (SDG indicator 3.1.1) \\ndropped by a third from 339 (80% UI: 319–360) deaths \\nper 100  000 live births in 2000 to 227 (80% UI: 211–246) \\ndeaths per 100  000 live births in 2015, equivalent to \\na 2.7% (80%, UI: 2.0–3.2%) average annual rate of \\nreduction (ARR). However, progress has stagnated \\nsince, and the global MMR only dropped to 223 (80% \\nUI: 202–255) deaths per 100  000 live births in 2020 as \\nthe ARR fell to –0.04% (80% UI: –1.6 to 1.1%) between \\n2016 and 2020 (Fig. 1.10). An estimated 287  000 (80% UI: \\n273 000–343  000) women globally died from a maternal \\ncause in 2020, a number that remained unacceptably high and is equivalent to almost 800 deaths every day or one every two minutes (3).\\nThe African Region remained the region with the highest \\nMMR throughout the two decades, despite a sustained decline with an ARR of 2%. The South-East Asia Region \\nhad experienced the steepest decline, reducing MMR from 372 (80% UI: 336–423) deaths per 100  000 live births \\nin 2000 to 117 (80% UI: 106–133) deaths per 100  000 live \\nbirths in 2020 and still maintaining an ARR at nearly 5% in the SDG era. Increasing MMRs were seen in the Region \\nof the Americas, the European Region and Western Pacific Region between 2016 and 2020, despite the \\nsizable decline during the MDG era. However, the levels \\nof MMR have remained below 80 deaths per 100  000 live \\nbirths in these three regions since 2000 (3).\\nTo achieve the SDG global target of MMR below 70 \\ndeaths per 100  000 live births by 2030, an ARR of 11.6% \\nis required between 2021 and 2030, equivalent to over \\n1 million deaths averted, compared with a scenario \\nwhere the 2016–2020 global stagnation continues (2, 3).\\nMortality among children under 5  years \\nof age and among newborns\\nSubstantial global progress has been made in reducing \\nchildhood mortality since 2000. The total number of \\ndeaths among children under 5  years of age worldwide \\ndeclined from 9.9  million (90% UI: 9.8–10.1  million) in \\n2000 to 4.9  million (90% UI: 4.6–5.4  million) in 2022, \\nreflecting a 51% decline in the global under-five mortality rate (U5MR, SDG indicator 3.2.1) from 76 (90% \\nUI: 75–78) deaths per 1000 live births in 2000 to 37 (90% \\nUI: 35–41) deaths per 1000 live births in 2022 (4).\\nFigure 1.10  Global MMR stratified by five-year time period, 2000–2020\\nPeriod\\nShaded area indicates 80% uncertainty intervals.2011–20152001–2005\\n2016–20202006–2010MMR\\n300\\n250\\n200\\n350\\n4\\n5\\n3\\n2\\n1\\nYear\\nSource: WHO et al.

Children in the African Region continued to have the highest risk of dying before reaching the age of five. In 2022, the U5MR in the region was 70 (90% UI: 63–82) deaths per 1000 live births, 10 \\ntimes the U5MR in the European Region (Fig. 1.11). In fact, \\nthe African Region accounted for over half (2.7  million, \\n90% UI: 2.5–3.2  million) of the total under-five deaths in 2022, while only accounting for 30% of the global live \\nbirths (4).\\nAt the country level, U5MRs in 2022 ranged from 1.5 (90% \\nUI: 0.7–3.1) deaths per 1000 live births to 117.3 (90% UI: 93.3–147.7) deaths per 1000 live births, which means that the risk of dying before turning five for a child born in the highest-mortality country was about 80 times that in the \\nlowest-mortality country (4).\\nFigure 1.11  U5MR and NMR, globally and by WHO region, 2022 \\nAfrican Region\\nEastern\\nMediterranean Region\\nSouth-East Asia\\nRegion\\nRegion of the\\nAmericas\\nWestern Pacific\\nRegion\\nEuropean Region\\nGlobal\\nUnder-five\\nNeonatal\\nUnder-five\\nNeonatal\\nUnder-five\\nNeonatal\\nUnder-five\\nNeonatal\\nUnder-five\\nNeonatal\\nUnder-five\\nNeonatal\\nUnder-five\\nNeonatal\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\n35\\n40\\n45\\n50\\n55\\n60\\n65\\n70\\nMortality rate (per 1000 live births)\\nSource : UNICEF et al.

However, the decline in \\nglobal neonatal deaths from 2000 to 2020, at 44%, has been slower compared with the 56% drop in the number \\nof deaths among children aged 1–59  months during the \\nsame period (4).\\nThe chances of survival from birth varies widely \\ndepending on where a child is born. The WHO African and \\nEastern Mediterranean regions had the highest neonatal \\nmortality rates (NMR, SDG indicator 3.2.2) in 2022 at 26 \\n(90% UI: 24–32) deaths per 1000 live births and 25  (90% UI: 21–30) deaths per 1000 live births, respectively  \\n(Fig. 1.11). With country-level NMRs in 2022 ranging from \\n0.7 (90% UI: 0.3–1.5) deaths per 1000 live births to 39.4 \\n(90% UI: 10.8–108.7) deaths per 1000 live births across the world, the risk of a newborn dying before their 28th day of \\nlife in the highest-mortality country was almost 60 times \\nthat in the lowest-mortality country (4).\\nProgress in reducing U5MR and NMR slowed in the first \\nhalf of the SDG era (2015–2022) compared with what was achieved in the MDG era (2000–2015). Globally, the \\naverage ARR in U5MR decreased from 3.8% (UI: 3.6–4.0%) \\nin 2000–2015 to 2.1% (90% UI: 0.9–2.7%) in 2015–2022. \\nSimilarly, the ARR for global NMR decreased from \\n3.0% (90% UI: 2.7–3.3%) in 2000–2015 to 1.8% (90% UI: \\n0.5–2.5%) in 2015–2022 (4).\\nIf current trends continue, 59 countries will not meet the \\nSDG target for U5MR (25 or fewer deaths per 1000 live \\nbirths by 2030). Even more countries are at risk of missing \\nthe SDG target for NMR (12 or fewer deaths per 1000 live \\nbirths by 2030): 64 countries will need to accelerate the mortality decline to meet the target on time. The majority \\nof the countries not on track to achieve the SDG targets are in the African Region, reinforcing the fact that children \\nface different chances of survival depending on where \\nthey are born. Reaching the targets in all countries and \\nareas will avert 9  million deaths among children under \\n5 years of age between 2023 and 2030, some 42% of \\nwhich would be among neonates (2, 4).\\n1.3.2  Mortality due to injury\\nRoad injury\\nDespite the growth in the global population and number \\nof vehicles, the global number of road traffic fatalities \\ndeclined by 5.9% from 1.25  million (UI: 1.11–1.39  million) \\ndeaths in 2010 to 1.18  million (UI: 1.05–1.30  million) deaths in 2021 (1, 5). While 10 countries in four regions \\nachieved the target to halve the number of road traffic \\ndeaths during this period, at the global level the \\nreduction fell far short of the target of the United Nations \\nDecade of Action for Road Safety 2010–2020, and at this \\npace the global target of the United Nations Decade of \\nAction for Road Safety 2021–2030 to halve deaths by 2030 \\nwould not be met either (6, 7). In 2021, the South-East Asia and the Western Pacific regions shouldered more \\nthan half of the global burden of road traffic deaths, with \\n319 000 (UI: 284  000–354  000) deaths (27% of the global \\nburden) and 298  000 (UI: 278  000–317  000) deaths (25% of \\nthe global burden), respectively (1, 5).\\nThe decline in the global number of deaths corresponds \\nto a 17% decline from the crude death rate (CDR) due \\nto road traffic injuries (SDG indicator 3.6.1) from 17.9 \\n(UI: 16.0–19.8) deaths per 100  000 population in 2010 \\nto 14.9 (UI: 13.3–16.4) deaths per 100  000 population in \\n2021. Declines in CDRs were observed in all regions in the period. However, the region with the highest CDR \\nin 2021 (the African Region, at 19.4 [(UI: 16.4–22.4]) \\nper 100  000 population) still had a CDR that was nearly \\nthree times as high as in the region with the lowest CDR \\n(the European Region, at 6.7 [UI: 6.2–7.3] per 100  000 \\npopulation). The slowest progress was seen in the Region \\nof the Americas, yet still even this was down by 9.4% from \\n15.6 (UI: 14.5–16.6) per 100  000 population in 2010 to 14.1 \\n(UI: 13.0–15.2) per 100  000 population in 2021. In 2021, \\nlow-income countries faced the highest CDR from road \\ninjuries at 21.3 (UI: 17.9–24.8) per 100  000 population, \\nwhile high-income countries had the lowest CDR at 7.6 \\n(UI: 7.1–8.2) per 100  000 population (1, 5).\\nSuicide\\nThe global total of suicide deaths decreased from an \\nestimated 762  000 (UI: 590 000–892 000) in 2000 to \\n717 000 (UI: 545 000–913 000) in 2021. The CDR from \\nsuicide (SDG indicator 3.4.2) declined steadily between \\n2000 and 2020 from 12.4 (UI: 9.6–14.5) deaths per 100  000 \\npopulation to 9.0 (UI: 7.0–11.3) deaths per 100  000 \\npopulation, and then increased slightly to 9.1 (UI: \\n6.9–11.6) deaths per 100  000 population in 2021 (1).\\nThe highest burden of suicide deaths shifted from the \\nWestern Pacific Region in 2000 (243  000 deaths, UI: \\n168 000–282 000) to the South-East Asia Region (206 000 \\ndeaths, UI: 151 000–257 000) in 2021, with the former seeing over a third reduction in suicide CDR from 14.5 \\n(UI: 10.1–16.8) per 100  000 population to 9.4 (UI: 7.0–12.1) \\nper 100  000 population, and the latter seeing a one fifth \\nreduction in CDR from 12.7 (UI: 9.4–15.1) per 100  000 \\npopulation to 10.0 (UI: 7.4–12.5) per 100  000 population \\nLife expectancy, healthy life expectancy and burden of disease in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic\\n17\\nbetween 2000 and 2021. The European Region also \\nobserved striking decline in suicide deaths, with CDR \\nfalling from 21.3 (UI: 19.8–22.9) per 100  000 population, \\nthe highest among all regions in 2000, to 12.3 (UI: 10.3–\\n14.4) per 100  000 population in 2021. The African Region \\nunderwent a very modest decline in suicide CDR between \\n2000 and 2020 (7.0 [UI: 4.5–10.2] per 100  000 population \\nto 6.9 [UI: 4.4–10.3] per 100  000 population), followed by \\nan increase to 7.2 (UI: 4.6–10.9) per 100  000 population \\nin 2021. The Eastern Mediterranean remained the region with the lowest CDR throughout the period. The Region of the Americas was the only region where overall increase \\nwas seen, rising from 7.2 (UI: 6.6–7.8) per 100  000 in 2000 \\nto 9.8 (UI: 8.7–10.8) per 100  000 in 2021 (1).\\nGlobally, the rate of suicide deaths for men was more than \\ndouble that for women in 2021 (CDR 12.3 [UI: 9.6–15.4] \\nper 100  000 population versus 5.9 [UI: 4.2–7.7] per 100  000 \\npopulation). However, the sex disparity was uneven across regions, with a male-to-female ratio ranging from \\nas low as 1.4 in the South-East Asia Region to nearly 4.0 in the Region of the Americas (Fig. 1.12) (1).Homicide\\nNearly 481  000 (UI: 360 000–649 000) people were \\nhomicide victims in 2021, although there was a slight \\nincrease (478  000 [UI: 400 000–578 000]) from 2000, \\ncorresponding to a decline in CDR by about 22%, from \\n7.8 (UI: 6.5–9.4) per 100  000 population in 2000 to 6.1 (UI: \\n4.6–8.2) per 100  000 population in 2021. About 80% of the \\nvictims were men (1).\\nThe WHO Region of the Americas had the highest \\nmortality burden from homicide in 2021 with a total  \\nof 199  000 (UI: 169 000–233 000) deaths, accounting  \\nfor 41.3% of the total global homicide deaths but only  \\n13.0% of the global population. In contrast, about a  \\nquarter of the global population resides in the Western  \\nPacific Region, but this region accounted for only 6.2% of global homicide deaths, with a CDR (1.6 [UI: 1.1–2.1] per \\n100 000 population) that was 8% of that in the highest  \\nregion (Region of the Americas, 19.4 (UI: 16.5–22.7) per  \\n100 000 population) and just about 16% of that in the  \\nsecond highest (African Region, 9.6 [UI: 5.9–15.1] per \\nFigure 1.12  Global and regional trends in the mortality rates due to suicide and homicide, 2000–2021\\nAfrican Region\\nRegion of the \\nAmericas\\nSouth-East Asia \\nRegion\\nEuropean Region\\nEastern Mediterranean \\nRegion\\nWestern Pacific \\nRegion\\nGlobal\\n2000\\n2021\\n2000\\n2021\\n2000\\n2021\\n2000\\n2021\\n2000\\n2021\\n2000\\n2021\\n2000\\n2021\\nHomicide\\nSuicide\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\n35\\nCrude death rate (per 100 000 population)\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\n35\\nCrude death rate (per 100 000 population)\\nFemale\\nMale\\nSource : WHO (1).\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n18\\n100 000 population) in 2021.

Globally, the male-to-female ratio for CDR for homicide mortality in 2021 was 4.0, ranging from about 2.8 in the South-East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean and European regions to 7.1 in the Region \\nof the Americas. A strong age pattern was also observed, \\nwith young adults at age 20–24 years having the highest age-specific mortality rate, peaking at 12.7 (UI: 9.5–17.1) \\ndeaths per 100  000 population globally and up to 40.6 (UI: \\n36.1–45.3) deaths per 100  000 population in the Region of \\nthe Americas (Fig. 1.12) (1).\\nUnintentional poisoning \\nGlobally, about 59  000 (UI: 32 000–90 000) people died \\nfrom unintentional poisoning in 2021, approximately down by over 4000 from the figure in 2000. This represents a drop in the CDR from unintentional poisoning (SDG indicator 3.9.3) of a quarter, from 1.0 (UI: \\n0.8–1.5) per 100  000 population in 2000 to 0.7 (UI: 0.4–1.1) \\nper 100  000 population in 2021. The highest CDR in 2021 \\nwas observed in the African Region at 1.2 (UI: 0.7–2.2) \\nper 100  000 population, closely followed by the Western \\nPacific Region at just under 1.2 (UI: 0.5–1.7) per 100  000 \\npopulation. The greatest decline in CDR was achieved in the European Region, with a nearly two thirds drop between 2000 and 2021. Slight increases were seen in the Region of the Americas and the Western Pacific Region (1).\\nSex and age disparity were observed. Men were dying \\nat a rate that was 68% higher than women. The greatest \\nmale-to-female ratios were observed in the Region of \\nthe Americas and the European Region at 2.3 and 2.6, respectively, whereas the lowest ratio was in the African Region at 1.4. The youngest and the oldest population were at the highest risk of dying from unintentional poisoning, with population under 5 years old and 65 years old and over accounting for less than 20% of the global population but nearly 40% of the global deaths from unintentional poisoning in 2021 (1).1.3.3  Mortality due to NCDs \\nImproved prevention, diagnosis and treatments has led to steady decline in premature mortality from NCDs. Globally, a person aged 30 years in 2000 had a 22.7% (UI: 18.7–27.2%) chance of dying from one of the four major NCDs (cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory \\ndisease and diabetes) before the age of 70 years (SDG \\nindicator 3.4.1). This risk fell to 18.2% (UI: 14.2–23.0%) in 2019 before the onset of the pandemic, corresponding to an approximately 20% reduction (1).\\nRegional disparity exists in both the levels and pace of \\nprogress. The Eastern Mediterranean Region started with the highest risk of premature mortality (27.2% [UI: 19.4–36.4%]) in 2000 and, notwithstanding a 15.4% reduction, the risk in 2019 (23.0% [UI: 15.9–31.5%]) remained high compared with other regions except for the South-East Asia Region, where the progress stagnated in 2000–2019. \\nIn contrast, the Region of the Americas had the lowest \\nrisk of NCD premature mortality (18.2% [UI: 16.6–19.9%]) in 2000 among all regions and stayed at the lowest level (13.9% [UI: 12.3–15.7%]) in 2019, with a 23.8% reduction between 2000 and 2019. The other three regions started at similar levels (22.2–23.9%) in 2000; however, the African Region saw more moderate decline (10.9%) and reached a premature mortality risk of 21.3% (UI: 13.5–31.3%) in 2019, whereas the fastest declines among all regions were observed in the European and Western \\nPacific regions (32.0% and 28.0% decline, respectively) \\n(Fig. 1.13) (1).\\nDespite the progress made, the pace of change in most \\ncountries has slowed since the beginning of the SDG era in 2015. With the global ARR slowing significantly (more than halved compared with the first 15 years of the century) between 2015 and 2019 to under 1%, the world is not on track to reach the 2030 SDG target. The only region where some acceleration was seen was the Eastern Mediterranean Region, yet the accelerated ARR was still less than half of that required to meet the SDG \\ntarget. The region of most concern in meeting the target \\nis South-East Asia Region, where the previous overall slow but still declining trend in 2000–2015 has reversed, with an increase in premature NCD mortality in 2015–2019. The other regions all underwent major declines in ARR, ranging from a 8% reduction in the African Region to over a third reduction in the Western Pacific Region (1).\\nLife expectancy, healthy life expectancy and burden of disease in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic\\n19\\nFigure 1.13  Trends in the probability of dying between ages 30 and 69 years from one of the four major NCDs, \\nglobally, by WHO region and by World Bank income group, 2000–2019\\nAfrican Region\\nRegion of the Americas\\nSouth-East Asia Region\\nEuropean Region\\nEastern Mediterranean Region\\nWestern Pacific\\nGlobal\\nGlobal\\nLow-income\\nLower-middle-income\\nUpper-middle-income\\nHigh-income\\nWorld Bank income groups\\nWHO region\\n2000\\n2005\\n2010\\n2015\\n2019\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\nRisk of premature death from target NCDs (%)\\nSource : WHO (1).\\nAbout 60 countries with good vital registration data that \\nare available for 2020 and/or 2021 present a mixed picture of NCD premature mortality during the pandemic.\\n2 Some \\ncountries saw further slowdown of reduction or even increasing NCD mortality during the pandemic as a result of disruptions to NCD services, while other countries observed accelerated decline in NCD premature mortality. \\nThe latter may well be an artefact, as patients with \\n2 Trajectories of NCD mortality after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic are still being understood.

Future work will explore how NCD mortality changed in these countries in 2020–2021 (1).NCDs are also at greater danger of dying prematurely \\nfrom COVID-19 as a competing risk (and so recorded as COVID-19 deaths). There are still many unknowns around the progress in NCD premature mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic that can only be answered with more \\nand better cause of death data to document the trends \\nduring and after the pandemic.\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n20\\n1.3.4  Mortality attributable \\nto environmental \\nrisk factors\\nMillions of deaths annually can be attributed to \\nenvironmental factors, such as air pollution and unsafe drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).\\nMortality attributed to air pollution\\nExposure to air pollution increases the risk for many negative health outcomes. Five health conditions – stroke, ischaemic heart disease, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults, and acute lower respiratory infections at all ages – are included in the \\nestimation of SDG indicator 3.9.1 on mortality attributed \\nto air pollution.\\nHousehold and ambient air pollution are estimated to \\nhave jointly caused 6.7  million deaths worldwide in 2019, \\ncorresponding to 4.2  million attributable to ambient air \\npollution and 3.2  million to household air pollution. The \\nglobal age-standardized mortality rate attributable to air \\npollution in 2019 was 104 (UI: 81–130) deaths per 100  000 \\npopulation, a slight decline from 133 (UI: 106–162) deaths \\nper 100  000 population in 2010. The African, Eastern \\nMediterranean and South-East Asia regions had the \\nhighest age-standardized mortality rates attributable to air pollution among WHO regions in 2019 (8).The causes of the observed differences in air pollution-\\nattributable mortality rates between regions and \\ncountries are diverse. First, they are due to the different (population-weighted) ambient and household particulate matter concentrations, but the different population distribution by age and underlying mortality patterns by cause also play a role.\\nMortality attributed to unsafe WASH\\nUnsafe WASH can lead to undesired health outcomes, including deaths. SDG indicator 3.9.2 is defined as mortality rate attributed to unsafe WASH, and considers four health conditions in the estimation, namely diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections, undernutrition \\nand soil-transmitted helminthiases. The latest estimate \\nsuggests that globally in 2019, safe WASH could have \\nprevented 1.4  million (UI: 1.3–1.5  million) deaths. An \\nestimated 395  000 of these deaths were among children \\nunder 5  years of age (9).\\nThe global WASH-attributable mortality rate in 2019 \\nwas 18.3 deaths per 100  000 population, ranging from \\n3.7 deaths per 100  000 population in high-income \\ncountries up to 41.7 deaths per 100  000 population in \\nlow-income countries. Among WHO regions, the highest mortality rates in 2019 were in the African Region \\n(46.7  deaths per 100  000 population) and the South-East \\nAsia Region (29.6 deaths per 100  000 population)  (9).\\nLife expectancy, healthy life expectancy and burden of disease in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic\\n21\\nReferences\\n1.

This chapter presents the latest \\navailable evidence of trends in health-related SDG and WHO \\nGPW13 indicators, assessing progress towards achieving the \\nglobal targets. The topics covered in this chapter include \\ninfectious diseases, risk factors for health, and health systems as a key to UHC. SDG indicators related to mortality are \\ndiscussed in Chapter 1.2.1 Infectious diseases\\n1 Percentage change in HIV incidence rate was calculated from unrounded incidence rates.SDG target 3.3 advocates to end the epidemics of HIV/\\nAIDS, tuberculosis (TB), malaria and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), and to combat hepatitis, waterborne diseases and other communicable diseases. This section describes the status of progress in the related \\nSDG indicators along with that in combating polio and \\nantimicrobial resistance (AMR).\\n2.1.1  HIV\\nAt the end of 2022, there were an estimated 39.0  million \\n(UI: 33.1–45.7  million) people living with HIV globally, \\nof which 37.5  million (UI: 31.8–43.6  million) were aged \\n15 years or older and 1.5  million (UI: 1.2–2.1  million) were \\nchildren aged under 15 years (2).In 2022, there were 1.3  million (UI: 1.0–1.7  million) new \\nHIV infections globally. This represents a 54% reduction \\nfrom 2.8  million (UI: 2.2–3.8  million) in 2000, and 27% \\nfrom 1.8  million (UI: 1.4–2.4  million) in 2015. The global \\nHIV incidence rate (number of new HIV infections per 1000 uninfected population, SDG indicator 3.3.1) was 0.17 (UI: 0.13–0.23) in 2022, a 32% reduction from 0.25 (UI: 0.19–0.33) in 2015. However, progress varied across regions. The Eastern Mediterranean Region has seen a \\n45% increase in HIV incidence rate since 2015, although \\nit still had the lowest number of new infections across WHO regions in 2022. HIV incidence rate declined by 31% during the same period in the South-East Asia Region, where both incidence rate and number are among the lowest. Despite impressive progress in reducing \\nincidence, the African Region continued to bear the \\nheaviest HIV burden (Fig. 2.1) (2, 3).\\n1\\nFigure 2.1  Percentage change in the number of new HIV infections per 1000 uninfected population,a 2015–2022, \\nand number of new HIV infections, 2022, globally and by WHO region\\n 56\\n 180\\n 140\\n 160\\n 110\\n 660\\n1 300\\nNumber of new \\nHIV infections (thousands), 2022\\nAfrican Region\\nGlobal\\nSouth-East Asia Region\\nRegion of the Americas\\nWestern Pacific Region\\nEuropean Region\\nEastern Mediterranean\\nRegion\\n-60\\n-40\\n-20\\n0\\n20\\n40\\nPercentage change in HIV incidence rate (2015–2022)\\n-32%\\n-53%\\n-31%\\n10%\\n45%\\n-7%\\n7%\\na P ercentage change in HIV incidence rate was calculated from unrounded incidence rates.\\nSource: Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (2, 3).\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n24\\nGlobal initiatives call for curbing the number of new \\nHIV infections to 370  000 in 2025 and 335  000 in 2030, \\nequivalent to HIV incidence rates of 0.05 in 2025 and 0.025 \\nin 2030 (4, 5). The latest estimates suggest that while the world is moving in the right direction, it is still far from reaching these targets.\\n2.1.2  TB\\nAn estimated 10.6  million (UI: 9.9–11.4  million) people \\ndeveloped TB globally in 2022, of which 55% were men, 33% were women and 12% were children under 15 years of age. The global TB incidence rate (SDG indicator 3.3.2) \\nwas 133 (UI: 124–143) per 100  000 population in 2022, \\ndown from 180 (UI: 134–233) per 100  000 population in \\n2000 and 146 (UI: 133–160) per 100  000 population in \\n2015. Figure 2.2 shows that TB incidence rates varied enormously across countries and areas in 2022 (6).The WHO End TB strategy calls for a 50% reduction of TB incidence rate by 2025 relative to the 2015 baseline, as a \\nmilestone towards the SDG 2030 and End TB 2035 targets \\n(7). While TB incidence rate had continuously declined for many years up to 2020, two consecutive years of global increases in TB incidence (in 2021 and 2022) led to the TB incidence rate in 2022 reverting to the level of 2019. Globally, the net relative reduction in the TB incidence rate from 2015 to 2022 was 8.7%, falling far behind the WHO End TB strategy milestone (6).\\nNevertheless, there were encouraging signs of progress. \\nThe global trends in the number of people diagnosed with TB and treated showed a major recovery in 2022, \\nafter a sharp drop in 2020 due to the disruptions related \\nto the COVID-19 pandemic (see section 2.3.1).\\nFigure 2.2  TB incidence rate by country and area, 2022\\nSource : WHO (6).\\nHealth-related SDGs\\n25\\n2.1.3  Malaria\\nIn 2022, there were an estimated 249  million (UI: 225–\\n278 million) malaria cases in 85 endemic countries and \\nareas, leading to an estimated 631  000 (UI: 587 000–\\n747 000) deaths (8).\\nThe Global technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030 (GTS) \\ncalls for a reduction in malaria case incidence by at least 40% by 2020, 75% by 2025 and 90% by 2030 from a 2015 baseline, among other milestones and targets (9). The global malaria incidence rate (malaria cases per 1000 population at risk, SDG indicator 3.3.3) was 59.8 (UI: 54.8–\\n65.7) in 2015, having declined by 26% from 81.0 (UI: 75.7–\\n87.7) in 2000. The incidence rate continued to fall until 2019, before rising by 3% in 2020 and remaining stable since. In 2022, the incidence rate was 58.4 (UI: 52.9–65.3); the expected rate was 26.2 if it was on trajectory to reach GTS targets. If the current trends continue, it is unlikely that the GTS incidence targets will be achieved) (8).The WHO African Region continues to bear the heaviest burden of malaria. In 2022, the region accounted for 94% of global malaria cases and 95% of global malaria deaths. Children under the age of five are particularly vulnerable; in 2022, almost four in every five malaria deaths in the region were among these young children (8).\\nWHO recently added the programmatic use of malaria \\nvaccines for children living in endemic areas to the malaria prevention toolbox. The first malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S), was recommended by WHO in 2021 after successful pilot programmes in Ghana, Kenya and \\nMalawi through the Malaria Vaccine Implementation \\nProgramme (Box 2.1). In 2023, WHO recommended a second safe and effective malaria vaccine, R21-Matrix-M (R21) (10). Wide implementation of malaria vaccines is expected to save tens of thousands of lives each year.\\nBox 2.1  Malaria vaccine implementation in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi\\nThe Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP) was established by WHO to evaluate the public health \\nuse of the first malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01 (10) . Findings from the pilot programme informed the historic WHO \\nrecommendation in October 2021 for a vaccine to prevent malaria in children.\\nThrough the collaborative effort with the ministries of health in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi from 2019 to 2023, \\nthe RTS,S malaria vaccine was integrated into routine child immunization services as part of each country’s national malaria control programme. Over 2 million children received the RTS,S malaria vaccine through the pilot. Findings from MVIP show that the RTS,S vaccine substantially reduces early childhood deaths and hospitalizations for severe malaria.\\nIn October 2023, WHO recommended a second safe and effective malaria vaccine, R21, for routine use. This \\nrecommendation, resulting in sufficient vaccine supply to scale up malaria vaccines broadly, coupled with the \\nhigh impact seen with the introduction of the RTS,S vaccine, underscores the potential of malaria vaccines as \\nimportant interventions to act against Plasmodium falciparum , the deadliest malaria parasite globally and the \\nmost prevalent in Africa, and further supports the case for implementing the malaria vaccine as a routine child immunization. \\nThe wide-scale implementation of the malaria vaccines, which began in early 2024, holds the potential to save \\ntens of thousands of lives each year. This is not just a scientific breakthrough but a life-saving intervention that can significantly reduce the burden of malaria on our communities.\\nKey findings: substantial public health impact (11)\\nDisease surveillance during 46 months of RTS,S vaccine use and scale-up, as part of the MVIP, showed that malaria vaccine introduction resulted in a 13% vaccine-attributable reduction in all-cause mortality (excluding injury) among children age-eligible for vaccination compared with children living in areas where the vaccine was not in use. Substantial reductions in severe malaria and malaria hospitalizations of children were also documented. Measured impact was additional to the benefits from insecticide-treated mosquito net (ITN) use \\nand access to other child health interventions and care.\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n26\\nThese findings were measured in the context of vaccine scale-up, with an average third-dose coverage of about \\n68% and average fourth-dose coverage of about 40% across the three countries. The substantial public health \\nimpact of malaria vaccine is expected to increase as vaccine coverage increases.\\nFigure 2.3 shows the coverage of immunization with malaria and other vaccines in the MVIP areas in the three \\ncountries from 2020 to 2023.\\nFigure 2.3  Coverage of immunization with RTS,S vaccine (first, third and fourth dose), pentavalent vaccine \\n(third dose) and measles–rubella vaccine (first and second dose) in the MVIP areas in Ghana, \\nKenya and Malawi, 2020–2023\\nVaccine\\nYear\\nGhana\\nKenya\\nMalawi\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n100\\nCoverage (%)\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n100\\nCoverage (%)\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n100\\nCoverage (%)\\nPenta-3\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n2023\\nRTS,S-1\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n2023\\nRTS,S-3\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n2023\\nMR-1\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n2023\\nMR-2\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n2023\\nRTS,S-4\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n2023\\nSource : Administrative data, Essential Programme on Immunization, ministries of health of Ghana, Kenya and Malawi.\\nOther findings\\n• Malaria vaccine uptake is high, with no unintended consequences, such as reduction in ITN use, uptake of \\nother childhood vaccines or change in health-seeking behaviour.\\n• Quantitative analysis shows that parents understand that malaria vaccine reduces malaria but does not prevent all cases of malaria, and continue to use other preventive and care-seeking measures . \\n• Community demand for and health worker acceptance of malaria vaccine is high.\\n• The malaria vaccine has a good safety profile – with more than 6  million doses provided.\\n• In the three pilot countries, malaria vaccine even reached children who were not using other forms of malaria prevention, thereby extending the programmatic reach of malaria prevention interventions.\\nThe MVIP further established that a moderately efficacious malaria vaccine can have high effectiveness and \\nimpact and will be accepted by communities and health workers.\\nHealth-related SDGs\\n27\\nThe MVIP also provided critical information to inform the recently updated WHO recommendation for malaria \\nvaccines that applies to both RTS,S and R21 vaccines, and forged a pathway for future malaria vaccine \\ndevelopment. \\nNext steps\\nThe high demand for malaria vaccines is unprecedented. More than 20 countries have been approved for malaria vaccine introduction support by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and wider implementation began in 2024. \\nAs of 25 April 2024, eight countries in Africa offer the malaria vaccine as part of their childhood immunization \\nprogrammes (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi and Sierra Leone) and up to 10 additional countries are likely to introduce it this year. Implementing malaria vaccines in Africa represents an important step in the fight against the disease. At least 30 countries in Africa are interested in deploying malaria vaccines as part of their national malaria control plans.\\nMoreover, the ministers of health of 11 African countries representing the High Burden High Impact (HBHI) \\ncountries in Africa, met in Yaoundé, Cameroon, on 6  March 2024, and declared their unwavering commitment to \\nthe accelerated reduction of malaria mortality and pledged to hold each other and countries accountable for the \\ncommitments outlined in the Declaration for accelerated malaria mortality reduction in Africa: commitment that “No one shall die from malaria”.\\n2.1.4  Hepatitis\\nGlobally, an estimated 304  million people were living with \\nchronic hepatitis B and C in 2022, of whom 254  million \\nwere living with hepatitis B and 50  million with hepatitis \\nC. The estimated number of people newly infected by \\nviral hepatitis B and C declined from 2.5  million in 2019 to \\n2.2 million in 2022 (12). While this decline is encouraging, \\nit is still far from the 2030 targets of 170  000 new hepatitis \\nB infections and 350  000 new hepatitis C infections (5). \\nOf the 2.2  million new infections in 2022, more than \\n1.2 million (UI: 0.8–1.5  million) were hepatitis B and nearly \\n1.0 million (UI: 0.8–1.3  million) hepatitis C (12). \\nThe African Region saw an estimated 771  000 new \\nhepatitis B infections in 2022, representing 63% of the global incidence (Fig. 2.4) (12). It also had the highest \\nhepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence among \\nchildren under five years (SDG indicator 3.3.4)\\n2 in 2020, \\nat 2.53% (UI: 2.10–3.07%), more than double the global \\nprevalence of 0.94% (UI: 0.82–1.06%) (13).\\nIn 2022, the South-East Asia and the Eastern \\nMediterranean regions had the highest number of new \\nhepatitis C infections, with 225  000 and 183  000 cases, \\nrespectively (Fig. 2.4). The Eastern Mediterranean Region also had the highest total chronic hepatitis C infections at \\n11.7  million, 23% of the global total in 2022 (12). There is, \\nhowever, promising momentum in the region, as Egypt became the first country to achieve the “gold tier” status on the path to eliminating hepatitis C infection (Box 2.2).\\n2   The SDG fr amework currently uses “Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence among children under 5 years” as a proxy for the official indicator 3.3.4   \\n(Hepatitis B incidence per 100  000 population), reflecting the high burden of Hepatitis B in this age group.2.1.5  NTDs\\nThirteen of the 21 diseases or groups of disease recognized by WHO as NTDs are targeted for eradication, elimination of transmission or elimination as a public health problem, and 50 countries have eliminated at least one NTD. Bangladesh, for example, has \\nrecently eliminated lymphatic filariasis and visceral \\nleishmaniasis as a public health problem (Box 2.3). This is an encouraging sign that NTDs can be defeated by combining diverse interventions including mass and individual treatment, vector control, veterinary public health, and provision of safe water and sanitation.\\nThe NTD roadmap 2021–2030 calls for a 90% reduction \\nof the global population requiring NTD interventions between 2010 and 2030 (16). Between 2010 and 2022, the \\nreported number of people requiring mass or individual \\ntreatment and care for NTDs declined by 26% from \\n2.19  billion to 1.62  billion – progress in the right direction \\nbut not sufficient to reach the 2030 target without substantial acceleration (Fig. 2.5). In recent years, the world has faced multiple challenges in the fight against NTDs, including a slow recovery of NTD programmes after the massive service disruption at the start of the COVID-19 \\npandemic, an uncertain financial situation and the ever-\\nincreasing threat of climate change, which is likely to result in increased distribution of many NTDs (17).\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n28\\nFigure 2.4  Number of new hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections, by WHO region, 2022\\nHepatitis B\\nHepatitis C\\nWestern Pacific\\nRegion\\n98 000\\nWestern\\nPacific\\nRegion\\n83 000\\nSouth-East Asia Region\\n225 000\\nSouth-East Asia Region\\n266 000\\nRegion of the Americas\\n176 000\\nEuropean Region\\n126 000\\nEuropean Region\\n18 000\\nEastern\\nMediterranean\\nRegion\\n183 000\\nEastern\\nAfrican Region\\n172 000\\nAfrican Region\\n771 000\\nMediterranean\\nRegion\\n86 000\\nRegion of \\nthe Americas\\n8 000\\nSource: WHO (12).\\nHealth-related SDGs\\n29\\nBox 2.2  Egypt becomes the first country to achieve the “gold tier” status on the path \\nto elimination of hepatitis C \\nIn 2023, Egypt became the first country to achieve gold tier status on the path to eliminating hepatitis C in \\naccordance with WHO criteria. This means that Egypt has fulfilled WHO’s targets that will set the country up to \\nachieve the reduced incidence and mortality targets of full elimination before 2030. Egypt has implemented one of the world’s largest nationwide public health screening and treatment programmes for hepatitis C.\\nEgypt had one of the highest rates of viral hepatitis in the world. Between the 1950s and 1980s, inadvertent \\ninfection transmission associated with unsafe injection practices occurred in the attempt to control schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease carried by water snails.\\nSince the early 1990s, the government has put a huge effort into strengthening hepatitis prevention, with \\nprogrammes covering blood safety, infection control and injection safety. It also worked on raising public \\nawareness and running harm reduction programmes.\\nEgypt launched a network of specialized treatment centres in 2006 and, with the new antiviral medicines \\ndiscovered in 2014, hepatitis testing and treatment were made accessible and free of charge for everyone.\\nIn 2018, the government launched the presidential initiative “100  million seha” (100  million healthy lives), a \\nmassive and unprecedented nationwide campaign to detect and treat everyone with hepatitis C, escalating its \\nelimination efforts.\\nThrough the campaign, everyone over 18 was tested, later expanding to children 12 years and older. In addition \\nto routine testing at all health facilities, the campaign used outreach in the community, with teams visiting big squares, markets, workplaces, sports clubs, mosques and churches, and popular meeting places such as barbershops. Vulnerable communities such as refugees and migrants, and persons with disabilities were also included, to leave no one behind.\\nBetween 2018 and 2022, over 60  million people were tested with WHO-approved rapid diagnostic tests. Patients \\nwere also assessed and treated for other chronic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes. A total of \\n4.1 million received treatment for hepatitis C with locally manufactured medicines between 2014 and 2022, of \\nwhich 98% were virally suppressed.\\nExpanding direct public health approaches to community prevention, testing and treatment, as shown by \\nEgypt’s successful public health programme to eliminate hepatitis C, can have a population-wide impact.\\nA case study concluded that five key elements contributed to Egypt’s successful programme: the availability \\nof sufficient and reliable epidemiological data; a robust public health care infrastructure; inclusive care that reached all sectors of society; political commitment with increased health-care spending and a comprehensive long-term strategy for viral hepatitis; and use of innovation and information technology (14) .\\nSource: WHO (15).\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n30\\nFigure 2.5  Global trend in the reported number of people requiring mass or individual treatment and care for \\nNTDs, and its relative reduction, 2010–2022\\n2010\\n2011\\n2012\\n2013\\n2014\\n2015\\n2016\\n2017\\n2018\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n1 000\\n1 100\\n1 200\\n1 300\\n1 400\\n1 500\\n1 600\\n1 700\\n1 800\\n1 900\\n2 000\\n2 100\\n2 200\\n2 300\\nNumber of people requiring interventions against neglected tropical diseases (million)\\n0\\n2\\n4\\n6\\n8\\n10\\n12\\n14\\n16\\n18\\n20\\n22\\n24\\n26\\nPercentage reduction from baseline\\n12%\\n18%\\n0%\\n1%\\n19%\\n20%\\n20%\\n20%\\n21%\\n3%\\n26%\\n7%\\n25%\\nNumber of people (millions)\\nPercentage reduction\\nSource : WHO (17).\\nHealth-related SDGs\\n31\\nBox 2.3  Bangladesh eliminates visceral leishmaniasis and lymphatic filariasis as a \\npublic health problem \\nIn 2023, Bangladesh became the first country globally to be validated for elimination of visceral leishmaniasis, \\nalso called kala azar , as a public health problem. The country achieved the elimination target of less than \\none case per 10  000 population at the sub-district ( upazila ) level in 2017 and has sustained it to date despite \\ndisruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nIn 2005, Bangladesh, together with India and Nepal, launched a Regional Kala-azar Elimination Initiative with \\nthe aim of wiping out the disease. The Government of Bangladesh, WHO, the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) and several other partners supported research and development of new diagnostic tools, effective treatments and vector control (especially indoor residual spraying), and facilitated their roll-out and access by all those in need through donation programmes, which helped the country meet the \\ncriteria set by WHO for elimination as a public health problem (18) .\\nKala azar is the most severe form of leishmaniasis and is transmitted by sandflies; it is commonly prevalent \\namong the most disadvantaged rural communities. The disease leads to symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and spleen and liver enlargement and, if left untreated, can prove fatal in over 95% of cases.\\nIn 2023, Bangladesh was also validated as the fourth country in the WHO South-East Asia Region to eliminate \\nlymphatic filariasis as a public health problem, after Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand.\\nLymphatic filariasis, also known as elephantiasis, occurs when filarial parasites are transmitted to humans \\nthrough mosquito bites. The infection is usually acquired in childhood with painful and disfiguring visible manifestations appearing much later in life, often in the form of enlargement of body parts, causing pain, severe disability and associated stigma.\\nLymphatic filariasis was a major public health problem in Bangladesh and was endemic in 19 of its 64 districts. \\nIn 2001, the country established a national elimination programme. Between 2001 and 2015, high-coverage mass drug administration campaigns were carried out in all endemic districts. A series of transmission assessment surveys was carried out by programme personnel between 2011 and 2021, which demonstrated that transmission levels were below the threshold established by WHO for elimination as a public health problem.\\nTo meet WHO’s validation criteria on morbidity management and disability prevention (19), Bangladesh also \\nstrengthened access to the recommended essential package of care in all endemic districts. Notably, over 31  000 \\npeople affected by lymphatic filariasis have been trained in self-care and provided with kits to manage their \\ndisease condition and improve their quality of life.\\nFor both kala azar and lymphatic filariasis, Bangladesh will now focus on post-validation surveillance to sustain \\nits hard-won status and prevent recurrence of infection.\\nSource: WHO (20, 21).\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n32\\n2.1.6  Polio\\nPoliomyelitis (polio) is a highly infectious viral disease. \\nIt primarily affects children under 5 years of age, but an unvaccinated person at any age can contract the disease. Of the three strains of wild poliovirus (type 1, type 2 and type 3), wild poliovirus type 2 was eradicated in 1999 and \\nwild poliovirus type 3 was eradicated in 2020. As at 2022, \\nendemic wild poliovirus type 1 remains in two countries, Afghanistan and Pakistan.\\nIn 2023, a total of 12 cases of wild poliovirus were \\nreported in Afghanistan and Pakistan and, unlike in previous years, no cases were reported from non-endemic countries (22).\\nAlthough immunization coverage, including polio, began \\nto recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic \\nduring 2022, progress is uneven. There were 14.3  million \\nchildren missing out on any vaccination – the so-called \\n“zero-dose children” – worldwide in 2022. Afghanistan \\nand Pakistan were among the top 15 countries with the highest number of zero-dose children in 2022, highlighting the need for continued, intensified efforts to \\nreach all remaining un- or under-immunized children in \\nthose endemic areas (23).\\n2.1.7  Antimicrobial resistance\\nAMR affects countries in all regions and at all income levels. It is a complex problem that requires both sector-specific actions in the human health, food production, animal and environmental sectors, and a coordinated approach across these sectors. In 2015, the World Health \\nAssembly adopted the Global Action Plan on AMR, \\ncommitting, among other things, to the development and implementation of multisectoral national action plans (24). As of November 2023, some 178 countries had such plans developed. However, in 2023 only 27% of countries reported implementing their national action plans \\neffectively and only 11% had allocated national budgets \\nto do so (25).SDG indicator 3.d.2 is defined as the percentage of bloodstream infections due to selected antimicrobial-resistant organisms. Median resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) were 41% and 32% in 2021, respectively, compared with 26.9% and 13.4% in 2016. However, no conclusions can be made on whether changes in resistance have occurred over time. The reasons for this are twofold: first, the pool of reporting countries has changed significantly \\nover the years. In 2016, only 16 countries contributed \\ndata on resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in E. coli, compared with 77 in 2021. Similarly, only 15 countries provided data in 2016 on methicillin resistance in \\nS. aureus  in 2016, compared with 78 in 2021. Second, \\nthe number of resource-limited settings providing data has increased in recent years. Testing coverage in these settings is often low, with data often limited to tertiary referral, private hospitals and/or research facilities, \\nand biased towards complex infections and treatment \\nfailures. Higher median resistance in recent years is at least in part consistent with potential biases resulting from the convenience sampling of health facilities for reporting AMR data in many settings (26).\\nPriorities to address AMR include surveillance of \\nantimicrobial consumption. The Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) provides a common and standardized set of methods for measuring and reporting. Of the 57 countries with data (2018–2021), 36 (63%) achieved the target of at least 60% \\nof total antibiotic consumption being “Access” group \\nantibiotics (26). The overall goal is to reduce the use of “Watch and reserve” group antibiotics and to increase the relative benefit and the availability of Access group antibiotics, where needed.\\nHealth-related SDGs\\n33\\n2.2 Risk factors for health\\nMany factors affect the health of individuals and \\ncommunities. A risk factor for health is any attribute, \\ncharacteristic or exposure of an individual that \\nincreases their likelihood of developing a disease or injury. This section presents progress towards achieving SDG and GPW13 targets related to several risk factors for health.\\n2.2.1  Nutritional risk factors\\nBetter nutrition is related to improved infant, child and maternal health, stronger immune systems, lower \\nrisk of NCDs, and longevity. Today, the world faces \\nthe multiple burden of malnutrition that comprises undernutrition, overweight (including obesity) and micronutrient deficiencies. Section 4.1 discusses the global trends in undernutrition and overweight or obesity. This section summarizes the global progress towards the reduction of anaemia among women and \\nthe consumption of trans-fatty acids (TFA).\\nAnaemia among women\\nWomen with anaemia are more likely to experience \\nfatigue and impaired physical capacity in their daily \\nlives. Moderate and severe anaemia are also risk factors \\nfor adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.\\nGlobal trends in the prevalence of anaemia among all \\nwomen 15–49 years of age (SDG indicator 2.2.3) show no \\nsignificant change from 31.2% (UI: 28.7–34.1) in 2000 to 29.9% (UI: 27.0–32.8) in 2019. With population growth, \\nthe total number of women aged 15–49 years affected \\nincreased from 493  million in 2000 to 571  million in \\n2019. While there was a slight decrease in anaemia prevalence among pregnant women from 40.9% (UI: \\n38.7–43.1) in 2000 to 36.5% (UI: 34.0–39.1) in 2019, prevalence among non-pregnant women remained stagnant, at 30.7% (UI: 28.1–33.7) in 2000 and 29.6% (UI: \\n26.6–32.5) in 2019 (27). Across WHO regions, the decline \\nin anaemia prevalence among women observed during the MDG era either halted or slowed after 2015. This \\nlatest evidence suggests that the global target of 50% \\nreduction of anaemia in women of reproductive age by \\n2025 (from a 2012 baseline) is unlikely to be met (27, 28).\\nTrans-fatty acids\\nIntake of TFA is associated with increased risk of heart attacks and death from coronary heart disease. WHO \\ndesignated TFA elimination as one of its priority targets in 2018, calling for the global elimination of industrially \\nproduced TFA by 2023.\\nMandatory TFA policies are currently in effect in 69 \\ncountries in all WHO regions, covering 55% of the global \\npopulation (4.4  billion people). Of these countries, 53 \\nhave “best-practice” policies, which include mandatory \\nnational limit of 2  g of industrially produced TFA per \\n100 g of total fat in all foods and mandatory national \\nban on the production or use of partially hydrogenated oils as an ingredient in all foods. Population coverage \\nby best-practice TFA policies has grown considerably. In \\n2018, best-practice policies were in effect for just 6% of \\nthe global population (480  million people). By the end \\nof 2023, this has increased to 46% coverage (3.7  billion \\npeople) (29). However, accelerated actions are needed to meet the target of 100% global population \\ncoverage (30).\\n2.2.2  Behavioural risk factors\\nModifiable behaviours such as tobacco use, alcohol \\nconsumption, physical inactivity and an unhealthy diet \\nare among the known risk factors associated with NCDs. \\nThis section summarizes the global progress towards the reduction of tobacco use and alcohol consumption.\\nTobacco use\\nThe Global action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs 2013–2020, which has been extended until 2030, \\nincludes a target for reducing the global prevalence of \\ntobacco use by 30% by the year 2025, relative to 2010 (31, 32).\\nIn 2022, the global age-standardized prevalence of \\ncurrent tobacco use among persons aged 15 years \\nand older (SDG indicator 3.a.1) was estimated at 20.9% (UI: 18.8–22.9), a 21% relative decline from \\n26.4% in 2010. If current trends continue, the world \\nwill see a 25% relative reduction in prevalence by 2025. While this is short of the 30% reduction target, progress is encouraging as tobacco use has been \\ndeclining in all WHO regions. The South-East Asia \\nRegion, having consistently the highest prevalence since 2000, is projected to achieve a 34% reduction by 2025 relative to 2010. The African Region is expected \\nto reach a 32% relative reduction by 2025 and remain \\nthe region with the lowest prevalence. The European \\nRegion, in contrast, is projected to have the highest \\nprevalence across all WHO regions in 2030 at 23.1% (33). Owing to its long history of tobacco control, the \\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n34\\nNetherlands (Kingdom of the) is among the countries to \\nhave experienced a decline in tobacco use faster than the European regional average, and one of only four countries worldwide to have attained best-practice level adoption of all MPOWER measures\\n3 (Box 2.4) (33, 34).\\n3   MPO WER is WHO’s technical package that assists countries to implement the evidence-based demand-reduction measures of the WHO Framework Convention \\non Tobacco Control. Tobacco use prevalence differs markedly by sex. While the prevalence among both men and women has decreased since 2000, it has remained much higher among men than women in 2022, both globally and in all six WHO regions (33).\\nBox 2.4  Tobacco control in the Netherlands (Kingdom of the)\\nThe estimated age-standardized prevalence of tobacco use among persons aged 15 years and older in the \\nNetherlands (Kingdom of the) declined from 34.5% (UI: 27.7–41.2) in 2000 to 27.7% (UI: 23.3–32.2) in 2010 and 21.3% (UI: 17.1–25.5) in 2022. If current trends continue, the prevalence is projected to reduce further to around 19.9% (UI: 15.8–24.1) in 2025 (33) . This would represent a 28% relative reduction over the period 2010–2025, close \\nto the 30% voluntary reduction target under the Global action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs (31) . \\nOn average, prevalence in the WHO European Region is projected to reduce more slowly, by 17% over the same \\nperiod.

In 2022, total taxes represented \\nclose to 77% of the retail price of the most sold brand.\\nIn the 2023 WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic , the Netherlands (Kingdom of the) is featured as one of \\nonly four countries in the world that have attained best-practice level adoption of all MPOWER measures – WHO’s \\ntechnical package that assists countries to implement the evidence-based demand-reduction measures of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (34) .\\nAlcohol consumption\\nSDG indicator 3.5.2 is defined as total (recorded and \\nunrecorded) alcohol per capita consumption (APC) per year, adjusted for tourist consumption, in persons aged 15 years and older, measured in litres of pure alcohol. Globally in 2019, the total APC stood at 5.5 litres (UI: 4.8–6.2), a 4.5% decline from 5.7 litres (UI: 5.1–6.4) in 2010 (35). Comparing this pace of decline with the global targets of at least 10% reduction by 2025 and at least 20% by 2030, it is evident that acceleration is needed (31, 36, \\n37). Moreover, the 2019 global APC was still higher than \\nthe 2000 level (5.1 litres, UI: 4.6–5.6) (35).\\nDespite consistent reduction since 2000, including 9.8% \\nreduction since 2010, the European Region continued to have the highest total APC. The South-East Asia Region \\nis the only region where total APC has continuously \\nincreased, although the rise has considerably slowed \\nsince 2010. Total APC remained very low in the Eastern \\nMediterranean Region, with total APC of 0.3 litres (UI: \\n0.2–0.5) in 2019. As with tobacco use, globally alcohol \\nconsumption among men has been consistently higher \\nthan among women. Box 2.5 presents an analysis of sex-\\nrelated inequalities in alcohol consumption globally and \\nby WHO region (35).\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had an apparent impact on \\nalcohol consumption globally, although its magnitude \\nand duration remain to be reliably defined.

In 2019, alcohol consumption among men was four times that among \\nwomen. Between 2000 and 2019, alcohol consumption did not change substantially among men (from 8.0 litres of pure alcohol [UI: 7.2–9.0] in 2000 to 8.7 litres of pure alcohol [UI: 7.7–9.9] in 2019) and women (2.1 litres of pure alcohol [UI: 1.9–2.4] in 2000 and 2.2 litres of pure alcohol [UI: 2.0–2.5] in 2019).\\nThe situation varied across WHO regions (Fig. 2.7). The largest absolute sex-related inequalities in 2019 were \\nevident in the European Region (difference of 10.9 percentage points between men and women), followed by the Region of the Americas (difference 8.7 percentage points), the Western Pacific Region (difference 7.2 percentage \\npoints), the African Region (difference 5.9 percentage points) and the South-East Asia Region (difference \\n5.1 percentage points). Between 2000 and 2019, absolute sex-related inequality increased in the South-East \\nAsia and Western Pacific regions due to a faster increase in alcohol consumption among men than women. \\nAbsolute sex-related inequality decreased in the African and European regions due to a faster decrease in alcohol consumption among men than women.

This section summarizes the global progress towards the reduction of hypertension; overweight and obesity are discussed in \\nsection 4.1.\\nHypertension\\nFor the purpose of monitoring population health, \\nhypertension is defined as having raised blood pressure\\n4 or taking medication for hypertension. The \\nage-standardized prevalence of hypertension among adults aged 30–79 has changed little in the past three decades globally and in all WHO regions, with a notable exception in the European Region, where there has been \\na continuous decline. In 2019, the global prevalence stood \\nat 33.1% (UI: 31.5–34.8%), and slightly higher among men (34.5%; UI: 32.0–36.9%) than women (31.7%; UI: \\n29.6–33.9%). However, available data suggests a higher \\ntreatment coverage among women globally, leading to a higher prevalence of controlled hypertension than for men (Box 2.6) (39).\\nThe voluntary global target on blood pressure envisages \\na 25% reduction in raised blood pressure (uncontrolled hypertension) by 2025 against a 2010 baseline (31, 32). Globally, the age-standardized prevalence of uncontrolled \\nhypertension declined slightly from 28.6% (UI: 28.0–\\n29.3%) in 2010 to 26.2% (UI: 24.7–27.8%) in 2019, but this pace of decline is insufficient to achieve the global target by 2025 (39).\\n4  Defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥  140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥  90 mmHg, regardless of diagnosis or medication status.2.2.4  Environmental \\nrisk factors\\nHuman health is dependent on a variety of environmental \\nfactors, such as safe WASH, clean air, safe chemical use, healthy built environments, sound agricultural practices, and protected natural areas and water sources. This section outlines the global progress towards universal \\naccess to WASH and the reduction of air pollution. Trends \\nin mortality attributable to environmental risk factors are discussed in Chapter 1.\\nWASH\\nBetween 2000 and 2022, worldwide some 2.1  billion \\npeople gained access to safely managed drinking \\nwater (687  million increase since 2015) and 2.5  billion \\npeople gained access to safely managed sanitation \\n(902  million increase since 2015). Since 2015, the number \\nof people with basic hygiene services has increased by \\nover 1  billion. Access to safe WASH services improved \\nsignificantly in rural areas between 2015 and 2022, but progress is limited in urban areas, when measured by the proportion of the population gaining services. However, because of population growth in urban areas, the number of people who have gained access to safely managed \\ndrinking water and sanitation services since 2015 is \\nhigher in urban than in rural areas (Fig. 2.9) (40).\\nBox 2.6  Global sex-related inequalities in hypertension\\nGlobally, there are sex-related inequalities in age-standardized prevalence of hypertension among adults aged \\n30–79 years. While there was no sex-related inequality in 1990 (prevalence of 32.4% [UI: 29.9–35.0] among men and 32.2% [UI: 29.7–34.9] among women), hypertension prevalence was slightly higher among men (34.5%; UI: 32.0–36.9) than women (31.7%; UI: 29.6–33.9) in 2019 (Fig. 2.8).\\nAge-standardized coverage of treatment for hypertension among adults aged 30–79 years with hypertension \\nlargely increased between 1990 and 2019, with the pace of increase slowing down slightly during the past decade, among both men and women. In contrast to hypertension prevalence, which was 2.8 percentage points higher among men than women in 2019, treatment prevalence was 9.3 percentage points higher among women \\n(47.2%; UI: 43.4–50.9) than men (37.9%; UI: 34.5–41.1) in 2019.\\nConsequently, age-standardized prevalence of controlled hypertension among adults aged 30–79 years with \\nhypertension also increased between 1990 and 2019, with faster improvements among women than men, leading to an increase in sex-related absolute inequality over time. In 2019, controlled hypertension prevalence \\nwas 5.1  percentage points higher among women (23.5%; UI: 20.4–26.9) than men (18.4%; UI: 15.9–21.2).\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n38\\nFigure 2.8  Global age-standardized prevalence, treatment coverage and controlled hypertension among \\nadults aged 30–79 years, by sex, 1990–2019\\nHypertension among adults aged 30–79 years (%)\\nTreatment (taking medicine) for hypertension \\namong adults aged 30–79 years\\n with hypertension (%)\\nControlled hypertension among adults \\naged 30–79 years with\\nhypertension (%)\\n1990\\n1992\\n1994\\n1996\\n1998\\n2000\\n2002\\n2004\\n2006\\n2008\\n2010\\n2012\\n2014\\n2016\\n2018\\n2019\\n1990\\n1992\\n1994\\n1996\\n1998\\n2000\\n2002\\n2004\\n2006\\n2008\\n2010\\n2012\\n2014\\n2016\\n2018\\n2019\\n1990\\n1992\\n1994\\n1996\\n1998\\n2000\\n2002\\n2004\\n2006\\n2008\\n2010\\n2012\\n2014\\n2016\\n2018\\n2019\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\nAge-standardized prevalence (%)\\nFemale\\nMale\\nShaded areas represent 95% uncertainty intervals.\\nSource: WHO (39) .  \\nFigure 2.9  Percentage increase in the proportion of global population with access to WASH services, and the number of people who gained access, 2015–2022\\nBasic\\nhygiene,\\nrural\\nSafely\\nmanaged\\nsanitation,\\nrural\\nSafely\\nmanaged\\nwater, rural\\nSafely\\nmanaged\\nsanitation,\\nurban\\nSafely\\nmanaged\\nwater, urban\\nBasic\\nhygiene,\\nurban\\n0\\n2\\n4\\n6\\n8\\n10\\n12\\nProportion increase in access (%)\\n469\\n547\\n218\\n355\\n415\\nInsuﬀicient\\ndata\\nNumber of \\npeople (millions) gaining access (2015–2022)\\nSource: UNICEF and WHO (40).\\nHealth-related SDGs\\n39\\nThe global coverage of safely managed drinking water \\n(SDG indicator 6.1.1) increased from 69% in 2015 to 73% in 2022, rising from 56% to 62% in rural areas and from 80% to 81% in urban areas. The coverage also varied \\ngreatly across WHO regions: in 2022, while nine out of 10 \\n(92%) people in the European Region had access to safely \\nmanaged drinking-water, only one third (33%) of people in the African Region did. To achieve the SDG target of \\nuniversal access by 2030, the overall rate of progress will \\nneed to increase sixfold (40).\\nSince 2015, the global coverage of safely managed \\nsanitation (SDG indicator 6.2.1) has increased from 49% to 57% in 2022, rising from 36% to 46% in rural areas and from 60% to 65% in urban areas. The African \\nRegion remained the WHO region with the lowest overall \\ncoverage, from 23% in 2015 to 26% in 2022. The South-\\nEast Asia and Western Pacific regions experienced the \\nlargest increases during the same period, reaching 49% and 68%, respectively, in 2022. To achieve universal access by 2030, the global rate of progress will need to increase fivefold (40).\\nIn 2022, the global coverage of basic hygiene services \\n(SDG indicator 6.2.2) reached 75%, up from 67% in 2015. The coverage rose from 53% to 65% in rural areas, but \\nremained stable at around 83% in urban areas. Overall \\ncoverage also remained largely unchanged in the African \\nRegion at 26%, as the gain in rural areas was offset by \\nthe decline in coverage in urban areas from 40% in 2015 to 36% in 2022. To achieve universal access by 2030, the global rate of progress will need to increase threefold (40).\\nThe proportion of total, domestic and industrial \\nwastewater flows that are safely treated is monitored by \\nSDG indicator 6.3.1. Wastewater statistics, however, are at an early stage of development in many countries and there is a lack of reporting, especially from industrial sources. Among the 73 countries (representing 42% of the global population) reporting volumes of total wastewater generated and treated, 76% of total wastewater flows \\nreceived some level of treatment in 2022. Among the 42 \\ncountries (representing 12% of the population) reporting the type of treatment received, 60% of total wastewater flows had at least secondary treatment. In a separate calculation based on data from 140 countries and areas (representing 92% of all household wastewater flows), \\nan estimated 58% of household wastewater was safely \\ntreated in 2022 (41). \\nMany low- and middle-income countries lack domestic \\nresources to improve the water sector. Between 2021 \\nand 2022, official development assistance (ODA) disbursements to the water sector (SDG indicator 6.a.1) \\nrose by 11% to US$  9.1 billion, a rebound from the \\ndeclining trend seen over the previous five years. ODA commitments also increased by 16% to US$  11.4  billion. \\nHowever, water sector ODA disbursements as a \\npercentage of total ODA across all sectors decreased \\nto 3.2% in 2022, a historical low, and continuing a \\ndownwards trend which has accelerated since the start of \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (42).\\nThese trends show that while progress towards universal \\naccess to safe WASH has been made in some areas, there are still some gaps in data and service coverage. \\nSustained actions to promote equitable access to WASH \\nservices are necessary to tackle these challenges.\\nAir pollution\\nThe use of clean cooking fuels and technologies significantly reduces exposure to household air pollution, \\nparticularly among women and children who spend the most time near the domestic hearth. Globally, the proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technologies for cooking (SDG indicator 7.1.2) steadily improved from 49% in 2000 to 64% in 2015 and \\n74% in 2022. The access deficit therefore decreased \\nfrom about half of the world’s population in 2000, to a little over a third in 2015 and about a quarter in 2022. \\nHowever, this means that 2.1  billion people were still \\nrelying on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking \\nin 2022, and the target of universal access by 2030 will \\nnot be met if current trends continue. Moreover, rural populations continued to have lower access than urban \\npopulations. Box 2.7 presents an analysis of the urban–\\nrural inequalities globally and across WHO regions (43). \\nParticulate matter (PM) is a common proxy indicator \\nfor air pollution. In 2019, almost all (99%) of the world’s population was exposed to unhealthy levels of fine \\nPM. Globally, the annual average population-weighted \\nconcentration of fine PM in urban areas (SDG indicator \\n11.6.2) was 33  μg/m3 (UI: 32–34  μg/m 3) in 2019, over \\nsix times the recommended level for protecting public health according to the WHO air quality guidelines \\n(5 μg/m 3). However, it stood at around interim target 1 \\nof the guidelines (35  μg/m 3), and the five-year average \\nlevel of 2015–2019 (36  μg/m 3) was 9% lower than that \\nof 2010–2014 (39  μg/m 3), signalling improvement in \\noutdoor air quality globally. The Western Pacific Region \\nsaw the largest reduction (16%) in the levels of fine PM \\nbetween the two periods. The Region of the Americas and \\nthe European Region continued to have the lowest levels of fine PM since 2010 while simultaneously improving air quality over the years, thanks to regional cooperation and \\nlegislations (43).\\nAddressing air pollution contributes significantly to \\nsafeguarding public health, promoting SDGs and \\nmitigating climate change impacts.\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n40\\nBox 2.7  Urban–rural inequalities in access to clean fuels and technologies, globally and \\nby WHO region, 2000–2022\\nGlobally, there are urban–rural inequalities in access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking, with higher \\naccess in urban than rural areas. In 2022, access to clean cooking was 34 percentage points higher among urban \\n(88.3%; UI: 85.4–90.0) than rural areas (54.4%; UI: 49.3–58.7). However, this gap has been reducing continuously since 2000, due to a faster increase in access to clean cooking in rural than urban areas. While access to clean cooking was 51.5 percentage points higher among urban than rural areas in 2000, access in rural areas more than doubled between 2000 and 2022 (from 24.4% [UI: 20.5–29.8] in 2000 to 54.4% [UI: 49.3–58.7] in 2022), leading \\nto a reduction in urban–rural inequality over time.\\nThe situation varies across WHO regions (Fig. 2.10). Large absolute urban–rural inequalities occur in the African, \\nEastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia regions, where access was more than 30.0 percentage points higher \\nin urban than in rural areas in 2022. Elevated absolute inequalities with a difference of 20.0 percentage points or more between urban and rural areas were also present in the Region of the Americas and the Western Pacific Region. Small inequalities occur in the European Region (difference of 7.5 percentage points between urban and rural areas).\\nAccess to clean cooking was above 50% in both urban and rural areas in all WHO regions in 2022, except the \\nAfrican Region, where coverage was below 50% in both urban (44.7%; UI: 40.6–49.1) and rural areas (8.2%; UI: 6.6–10.2). The African Region was also the only region where absolute inequality has been increasing over time due to a faster increase in access to clean cooking in urban than rural areas (difference between urban and rural areas of 36.6 percentage points in 2022, up from 25.2 percentage points in 2000).\\nFigure 2.10  Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technologies for cooking (%), \\nby urban–rural place of residence, globally and by WHO region, 2000–2022\\n2000\\n2001\\n2002\\n2003\\n2004\\n2005\\n2006\\n2007\\n2008\\n2009\\n2010\\n2011\\n2012\\n2013\\n2014\\n2015\\n2016\\n2017\\n2018\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n100\\nProportion of population (%)\\nGlobal\\nAfrican Region\\nRegion of the Americas\\nSouth-East Asia Region\\nEuropean Region\\nEastern Mediterranean\\nRegion\\nWestern Pacific Region\\n2000\\n2011\\n2022\\n2000\\n2011\\n2022\\n2000\\n2011\\n2022\\n2000\\n2011\\n2022\\n2000\\n2011\\n2022\\n2000\\n2011\\n2022\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n100\\nProportion of population (%)\\nRural\\nUrban\\nShaded areas represent 95% uncertainty intervals.\\nSource: WHO (43).\\nHealth-related SDGs\\n41\\n2.2.5  Risks to women’s and \\ngirls’ health\\nWomen and girls face certain health risks as they are \\nin a disadvantaged position not only due to biological factors, but also sociocultural factors in some societies. For example, an emphasis on women’s reproductive roles, and potential or actual experience of physical, sexual and \\npsychological violence, may prevent women and girls \\nfrom fully accessing quality health services and attaining the best possible level of health.\\nAdolescent pregnancy\\nChild marriage and child sexual abuse place girls at increased risk of pregnancy, often unintended. In many places, barriers to obtaining and using contraceptives prevent adolescents from avoiding unintended pregnancies.\\nIn 2023, there were an estimated 12.7  million births \\namong teenage girls aged 15–19 years, and almost half a million births among very young girls aged 10–14 years, together representing 10% of all births worldwide. About one in six (16%) of all births in the WHO African Region, and about one in 10 (11%) in the Region of the Americas, \\nwas among adolescent mothers aged 10–19 years in 2023 \\n(Fig. 2.11) (44).\\nAdolescent birth rates (ABR) per 1000 girls (SDG indicator \\n3.7.2) have been falling since 2000, but the decrease has been slow and uneven. In 2023, the global ABR was 41.3 \\nbirths per 1000 girls aged 15–19  years, representing a \\n36% decline since 2000, and 12% since 2015 (Fig. 2.11). \\nAmong girls aged 10–14  years, the global ABR declined \\nfrom 3.3 in 2000 to 1.8 in 2015 and 1.5 in 2023. Since 2000, the European and Western Pacific regions have maintained the lowest ABR and the lowest proportion of births among adolescent girls out of all births, while the African Region continued to have the highest levels (44).\\nViolence against women\\nIntimate partner violence (IPV) – including physical, sexual and psychological violence – and sexual violence against women and girls cause serious short- and long-term physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health problems for women and girls. They also affect the health \\nand well-being of their children and families.\\nTrend analyses based on data up to 2018 suggest that \\nthere has been insufficient progress in reducing IPV \\nagainst women and girls over the past two decades (45). The latest estimates based on data from 161 countries and areas suggest that globally, in 2018, some 26% (UI: 22–30%) of ever-partnered women aged 15 years or older had experienced IPV at least once in their lifetime (SDG indicator 5.2.1) and 10% (UI: 8–12%) in the past \\n12 months. In the same year, 6% (UI: 4–9%) of all women \\naged 15 years or older had experienced lifetime non-partner sexual violence (SDG indicator 5.2.2) (46). The estimates also suggest that violence starts early in the lives of women. Adolescent girls aged 15–19 years experienced high rates of IPV, with 24% (UI: 21–28%) \\nof those partnered being subjected to physical and/\\nor sexual violence from an intimate partner at least once in their lives and 16% (UI: 14–19%) within the past \\n12 months (47).

Building on the 2019 Political Declaration on UHC (51), the 2023 Political Declaration provides a roadmap \\nto accelerate implementation towards achieving health \\nfor everyone, everywhere, and ensuring that no one is left behind. It acknowledges the importance of health systems strengthening based on a primary health care (PHC) approach, which is critical not just for centring people and communities, but also for effective health emergency prevention, preparedness, response and recovery, which has never been more salient than during the COVID-19 pandemic.UHC, grounded in the principle that all individuals and communities should have access to quality essential health services throughout the entire spectrum of care without enduring financial hardships, not only contributes to improving health outcomes (SDG 3) \\nbut also plays a pivotal role in other SDGs, including \\neconomic growth and job creation (SDG 8), gender equality (SDG 5), education (SDG 4), nutrition (SDG 2) and poverty reduction (SDG 1). Strengthening health systems and enhancing the sustainability and equity of health services and financing models are pivotal factors that contribute to the successful achievement of UHC. This section delves into SDG indicators related to service delivery and health financing, illustrating disparities across WHO regions and World Bank country \\nincome groups.\\nHealth-related SDGs\\n43\\n2.3.1  Service delivery\\nService delivery, the primary interface between health \\nsystems and people, includes a wide range of health service providers, but also public health-care institutions and other actors responsible for essential public health functions and provision of health-care products.\\nScaling up the coverage of essential \\nhealth services with an emphasis  \\non PHC\\nScaling up the coverage of effective essential health \\nservices is a fundamental strategy for achieving UHC. It aims not only to improve health outcomes but also to promote health equity and ensure that health care is universally accessible and of high quality.\\nSDG indicator 3.8.1, referred to as the UHC service \\ncoverage index, aims to measure the average coverage \\nof essential services through a single index score based \\non 14 indicators across four domains: reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH); infectious diseases; NCDs; and service capacity and access. This \\n5 Achieving the 95–95–95 targets requires that 95% of people living with HIV know their HIV status, 95% of people who know their status are receiving ART , and \\n95% of people on ART have suppressed viral loads. This translates to 95% of people living with HIV knowing their HIV status, 90% of people living with HIV receiving ART , and 86% of people living with HIV having suppressed viral loads.score increased remarkably from 45 to 68 between 2000 \\nand 2021 globally but progress has slowed since 2015 and even stagnated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The highest index scores were in the European Region, the Region of the Americas and the Western Pacific Region \\n(around 80), followed by South-East Asia (62), Eastern \\nMediterranean (57) and African regions (44). Figure 2.12 shows the scores by country in 2021 (52). \\nThe most significant improvements in the average \\ncoverage of essential health services occurred in the infectious diseases domain. HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment coverage increased from 2% (UI: 2–2%) in 2000 to 76% (UI: 65–89%) in 2022, yet still far from the 95–95–95 targets\\n5 for 2025 (2–4). There were \\nalso improvements in TB treatment coverage over the same period, from 34% (UI: 26–46%) in 2000 to 70% (UI: 66–76%) in 2022, with an apparent rebound in 2021 and 2022 after the sharp reversal of progress in 2020 (58%, \\nUI: 55–62%) due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 \\npandemic (6). ITN use to prevent malaria also increased between 2000 and 2022, from 2% (UI: 2–3%) to 49% (UI: 47–51%), although a stagnation was observed after 2015 (8).\\nFigure 2.12  UHC service coverage index, by country, 2021\\nSource: WHO and World Bank (52).\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n44\\nIn the area of RMNCH, the proportion of women of \\nreproductive age having their need for family planning \\nmet with modern methods (SDG indicator 3.7.1) saw \\na modest uptick from 74% in 2000 to 78% in 2023, still \\nfar from the target of universal access by 2030 (53). Similarly, the proportion of children who received \\nthree doses of the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) (SDG indicator 3.b.1 – DTP3) rose \\nfrom 72% in 2000 to 84% in 2022. However, a notable \\n5 percentage points coverage drop occurred between \\n2019 and 2021, followed by a 3  percentage points \\nincrease in 2022. The coverage of the two doses of the vaccine for measles (SDG indicator 3.b.1 – MCV2) \\nand three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine \\n(SDG indicator 3.b.1 – PCV3) also increased, reaching \\n74% and 60%, respectively, in 2022, with stagnations observed in 2020–2021. In contrast, global coverage \\nof Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (SDG indicator \\n3.b.1 – HPV), critical for women’s and girls’ health \\nglobally, only reached 15% in 2022, with 130 countries \\nhaving introduced the HPV vaccine in their national \\nimmunization services by the end of 2022. The 90% \\ntarget set by the Immunization Agenda is unlikely to be met for any of these vaccinations if current trends \\ncontinue ( 23, 54). Moreover, while there has been a \\npositive increase in the proportion of births attended \\nby skilled health personnel (SDG indicator 3.1.2), rising from 61% in 2000 to 86% in 2023 and notably improving outcomes in childbirth, it is important to acknowledge a slowdown in the pace of progress since 2015, and the global target of 90% coverage by 2025 is unlikely to be met unless progress is accelerated (55, 56).\\nPositive advancements have been observed in service \\ncoverage of NCDs, which continue to contribute the \\nhighest proportion of the disease burden. For example, \\naccording to the latest estimates, the proportion \\nof adults aged 30–70 years receiving treatment for \\nhypertension increased from 30% in 2000 to 42% in \\n2019. The effective coverage for hypertension treatment is estimated to have more than doubled from 9% to 21% \\nover the same period (39).\\nData on treatment coverage for alcohol and drug use \\ndisorders between 2015 and 2018 range from extremely low (0.3%) to a maximum of 35% for drug use disorders \\nand 14% for alcohol use disorders in the 20 countries \\nthat were able to report these data in 2019. To address \\nchallenges in estimating treatment coverage for \\nsubstance use disorders (SDG indicator 3.5.1), a service \\ncapacity index has been introduced as a complementary measure (index range 0–100). This index varied significantly among countries, with values ranging from 1 to 80 in 2019. The highest index values were observed in the European Region (49), while the lowest were in the African Region (25) (38).In most settings, efficiency and equity in the delivery \\nof health services requires an increased emphasis on \\nfrontline services, particularly PHC.\\nIncreasing the recruitment, \\ndevelopment, training and retention of the health workforce\\nHealth workers are the cornerstone of a resilient health \\nsystem, and the demand for health workers continues to increase as global health challenges become more \\ncomplex and the world’s population grows and ages. \\nTo make progress towards UHC, it is critical to address \\nthe global shortage of health workers, so that adequate \\nnumbers of health workers are available in the right \\nquantity in the right places, in alignment with population \\nhealth needs (57). Based on the latest data available \\nover the period 2015–2022 for each country, low-income \\ncountries had the lowest health worker density and \\ndistribution (SDG indicator 3.c.1) with a median of only 1.1 medical doctors (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.7–1.9), \\n7.5 (IQR: 5.0–11.2) nursing and midwifery personnel, \\n0.04 dentists (IQR: 0.01–0.20) and 0.2 (IQR: 0.1–0.4) \\npharmacists per 10 000 population, compared with \\nmedians of 35.6 (IQR: 29.3–43.5),  76.8 (IQR: 55.1–109.3), \\n7.0 (IQR: 4.8–9.1) and 8.8 (IQR: 6.7–11.1), respectively, \\nin high-income countries. An analysis of countries with \\navailable data over three consecutive time periods \\n(2010–2014, 2015–2019, 2020–2022) reveals a consistent \\nincrease in the density and distribution of health \\nworkers across all income groups, except for dentists in \\nlow-income and lower-middle-income countries, and \\npharmacists in middle-income countries (Fig. 2.13) (58). \\nHowever, even when national densities seem adequate, \\ndisparities persist at subnational level.\\nImproving access to medicines and \\nhealth technologies\\nTo achieve equitable access to medicines and health \\ntechnologies, major attention is required to this \\nsubsystem within health systems. Since 2015, the \\nproportion of health facilities that have a core set of \\nrelevant essential medicines available and affordable \\non a sustainable basis (SDG indicator 3.b.3) has been estimated for only 17 countries in the WHO Africa Region, \\nRegion of the Americas and European Region, with a \\nmedian value of 8% across the 17 countries (IQR: 0–22%) \\n(60). Work is ongoing to improve the methodology to \\nmeasure access to essential medicines and other health-\\ncare products to enable sustained global monitoring. \\nThe COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the huge and \\ngrowing divide between high- and low-income countries \\nin accessing medicines and health-care products, and \\nthe need for innovation and local production to enhance \\nthe equitable distribution of health-care products (i.e. \\nmedicines, vaccines, diagnostics and devices) (61).\\nHealth-related SDGs\\n45\\nFigure 2.13  Health worker density and distribution, by World Bank income group, 2010–2022 (median values)a\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\n35\\n40\\n2010–2014\\n2015–2019\\n2020–2022\\n2010–2014\\n2015–2019\\n2020–2022\\n2010–2014\\n2015–2019\\n2020–2022\\n2010–2014\\n2015–2019\\n2020–2022\\nLow-income\\nLower-middle-income\\nUpper-middle-income\\nHigh-income\\nMedian density per 10 000 population\\nMedical doctors\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\n80\\n90\\nLow-income\\nLower-middle-income\\nUpper-middle-income\\nHigh-income\\nMedian density per 10 000 population\\nNursing and midwifery personnel\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\nMedian density per 10 000 population\\nDentists\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\nMedian density per 10 000 population\\nPharmacists\\n2010–2014\\n2015–2019\\n2020–2022\\n2010–2014\\n2015–2019\\n2020–2022\\n2010–2014\\n2015–2019\\n2020–2022\\n2010–2014\\n2015–2019\\n2020–2022\\n2010–2014\\n2015–2019\\n2020–2022\\n2010–2014\\n2015–2019\\n2020–2022\\n2010–2014\\n2015–2019\\n2020–2022\\n2010–2014\\n2015–2019\\n2020–2022\\nLow-income\\nLower-middle-income\\nUpper-middle-income\\nHigh-income\\n2010–2014\\n2015–2019\\n2020–2022\\n2010–2014\\n2015–2019\\n2020–2022\\n2010–2014\\n2015–2019\\n2020–2022\\n2010–2014\\n2015–2019\\n2020–2022\\nLow-income\\nLower-middle-income\\nUpper-middle-income\\nHigh-income\\na   Data were available for the three periods in 123 countries (46 high-income countries [HIC], 30 upper-middle-income countries [UMC], 33 lower-middle-income \\ncountries [LMC], 14 low-income countries [LICs]) for medical doctors, 119 countries (45 HIC, 33 UMC, 27 LMC, 14 LIC) for nursing and midwifery personnel, 98 \\ncountries (43 HIC, 26 UMC, 23 LMC, 6 LIC) for dentists and 100 countries (43 HIC, 20 UMC, 25 LMC, 12 LIC) for pharmacists.

Service delivery models that are truly fit for purpose need to be equipped to implement the IHR and to develop a clear sense of the types of threats they may face and to prepare \\nfor them.\\nThe IHR States Parties Self-Assessment Annual Report \\n(SPAR) tool consists of 35 indicators for the 15 IHR \\ncapacities needed to detect, assess, notify, report and respond to public health risks and acute events of domestic and international concern (SDG indicator 3.d.1). Based on the analysis of the latest annual reporting data, the top challenges at the global level are policy, legal and normative instruments to implement IHR (C.1), chemical events (C.14), radiation emergencies (C.15) and human resources (C.6); while the top strengths are laboratory (C.4), surveillance (C.5), health emergency management \\n(C.7) and health services provision (C8). The European \\nRegion had the highest scores for the capacities related to zoonotic diseases (C.12), food safety (C.13), chemical events (C.14) and radiation emergencies (C.15), while the South-East Asia Region did particularly well for capacities related to policy, legal and normative instruments to implement IHR (C.1) and coordination and advocacy (C.2). The African Region had the lowest scores for all capacities with the exception of zoonotic diseases (C.12) \\n(Fig. 2.14) (62).\\nSPAR serves as a barometer for a nation’s preparedness \\nand response, and helps understand not only national capacities in health security but also how they fit in a regional and international context.

The South Pacific \\nspans one third of the Earth’s surface, yet it is inhabited by less than 1% of the global population. The remoteness of the region often functions as a gatekeeper for infectious diseases but makes it more likely for outbreaks of waterborne and foodborne diseases. The South Pacific is prone to extreme weather events, such as cyclones and flooding, which are increasing in intensity and frequency. Additionally, the South Pacific’s rising sea levels exceed \\nthe global mean rate (reaching about 4 mm per year), further increasing the region’s vulnerability (63) .\\nUntil 2023, a limited number of Pacific island countries submitted a SPAR regularly, making it difficult to identify, address and strengthen health security in the region. In August 2023, thirteen Pacific island countries committed \\nto bolstering health security reporting mechanisms during a meeting of Pacific IHR national focal points.\\nOne of the Pacific island countries with a complex set of challenges is Kiribati, which comprises 33 atolls \\nscattered across the equator and over 5  million square kilometres of water. In addition to infectious diseases, \\nnatural disasters such as the 2022 drought and the 2015 cyclone Pam have severely impacted Kiribati’s health \\nsecurity. The drought affected water and food access for 119  000 of the 131  000 people in Kiribati, while cyclone \\nPam caused widespread flooding and damage, including in the capital, Tarawa (63, 64) .\\nIn preparation for Kiribati’s Ministry of Health to submit IHR SPAR, a multisectoral consultation was organized \\nin collaboration with WHO in December 2023. The involvement of representatives from different sectors such as emergency response, agriculture, financing and legislation helped to ensure that the SPAR scores accurately reflected the country’s situation.\\nBy February 2024, Kiribati – together with 11 other Pacific island countries (Cook Islands, Fiji, Marshall Islands, \\nthe Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu) – submitted their SPARs. This has been the highest number of SPAR submissions in the region so far, shedding light on \\nareas for improvement. Areas with the biggest gaps in the South Pacific, scoring on average less than 60 out \\nof 100 points per area, are policy, legal and normative instruments to implement IHR; infection prevention and control (IPC); points of entry (PoEs) and border health; health services provision; zoonotic diseases; food safety; chemical events; and radiation emergencies. Countries also declared gaps in financing, human resources, IHR coordination, national IHR Focal Point functions and advocacy.\\nKiribati SPAR results in 2023 identified areas where more attention would be needed in cross-sectoral \\napproaches, including for zoonotic diseases, radiation emergencies and chemical events (Fig. 2.15). The review process for completing the SPAR helped to map out where there were capacity gaps and opportunities for strengthening in coming years. \\nRecognizing the importance of IHR, Kiribati integrates the SPAR score average as one of the indicators in its \\nNational Health Strategic Plan 2024–2027, with the 2023 assessment as the baseline (Fig. 2.15). There is a commitment in the National Health Strategic Plan to improve on the SPAR score in the coming four years with annual monitoring.\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n48\\nFigure 2.15  SPAR scores by capacity in Kiribati, 2023\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\nC.15 Radiation emergencies\\nC.14 Chemical events\\nC.13 Food safety\\nC.12 Zoonotic diseases\\nC.11 Points of entry and border health\\nC.10 Risk communication and community engagement\\nC.9 Infection prevention and control\\nC.8 Health services provision\\nC.7 Health emergency management\\nC.6 Human resources\\nC.5 Surveillance\\nC.4 Laboratory\\nC.3 Financing\\nC.2 IHR coordination, national IHR focal point functions and advocacy\\nC.1 Policy, legal and normative instruments to implement IHR\\nSource : WHO (62).\\n2.3.2  Health financing\\nHealth financing arrangements determine the ability of \\nhealth systems to respond to health needs, pool financial \\nrisks, and operate efficiently and equitably. They span \\nchoices and decisions in three interlinked financing functions – mobilizing resources, pooling them and using \\nthem to strategically purchase health services.\\nMobilizing resources and prioritizing \\nhealth\\nThe Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) recognized that \\nthe primary mechanism for meeting resource needs for \\nachieving the SDGs should be domestic (65).\\nIn 2021, global government health spending (the health \\ncomponent of SDG indicator 1.a.2) surged, except in \\nlow-income countries (Fig. 2.16). High- and upper-middle-income nations increased health priority due to \\nCOVID-19-related expenditures. In lower-middle-income \\ncountries, slower growth in health spending compared \\nwith general government spending resulted in reduced \\nhealth priority in almost half of them, though outliers boosted the average. Among low-income countries, half \\nsaw declining health priority as reduced government \\nhealth spending coincided with higher general spending. External aid likely played a significant role in financing \\nhealth-care expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic in \\nlow- and lower-middle-income nations, echoing a trend \\nwhere higher external funding in low-income countries \\ncorrelated with lower health priority in government budgets during the MDG period (66).Development assistance for health (DAH) \\nto complement domestic financing\\nAs part of the AAAA, countries committed to reverse \\nthe decline in aid to the poorest and fragile countries, \\nmany of which will require sustained DAH to address \\ncapacity constraints and continue progress toward \\nUHC. However, DAH must add to domestic resources \\nrather than crowding them out, and support efforts to \\nincrease the effectiveness and efficiency of domestic \\nresources utilization.\\nIn 2022, the African Region received the highest weighted \\naverage health ODA per capita (US$  5.35) compared with \\ncountries in other regions (less than US$  3 per capita) \\n(SDG indicator 3.b.2) (42). While DAH has undeniably \\ncontributed to noteworthy health improvements, the \\ncurrent architecture and incentives associated with such assistance have inadvertently led many nations to neglect funding for basic health services in their own budgets and become overly aid-dependent (68). The COVID-19 \\npandemic has shown the perils of overdependence on \\nexternal sources of finance and distant suppliers for \\ncritical health needs (69).\\nImprove financial protection for all\\nExpanding pooling arrangements is essential to provide protection from the economic consequences of ill health \\nand enhance equity in service use – to reduce foregone \\ncare for financial reasons, financial hardship due to out-\\nof-pocket (OOP) health payments and indebtedness due \\nto health cost.

The largest shares were reported in the Western Pacific Region (19.8%) and South-East Asia Region (16.1%); the lowest shares were reported in the Region of the Americas (7.8%) and the European Region (7.9%) (52).\\nEven prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and despite long-\\nstanding high-level commitments to health for all and \\nUHC, progress was largely off-track. Many governments \\nhave neglected foundational investments in health \\nsystems. Consequently, health services have been \\ndisrupted and inequities between and within countries have worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Functioning as both an impact measurement tool and a \\npolicy strategy, they are an integral part of the GPW13 Results \\nFramework. The targets focus on achieving measurable \\nimpacts on people’s health at the country, regional and global \\nlevels. They are tangible, related to human lives and able to \\ndrive changes.Triple  Billion targets are based on 46 outcome indicators \\nto track the progress that WHO and its Member States \\nachieve in improving population health at the country \\nlevel. The indicators include 39 SDG indicators, and \\nseven non-SDG indicators approved by WHO Member \\nStates to address country priorities during the 72nd \\nWorld Health Assembly (WHA 72) in 2019 (3, 4). The close alignment between the Triple Billion and SDGs enables \\ncountries to apply Triple Billion targets in delivering their commitments on the SDGs.\\nTriple Billion projections were calculated for the years \\n2019–2025 relative to a 2018 baseline, providing much-\\nneeded milestones for progress made at the global, \\nregional and country levels in providing, promoting and \\nprotecting global health. This chapter focuses on the \\nglobal and regional results to date (5). Overall, the world has collectively achieved the healthier \\npopulation  billion target, but is lagging on the other \\ntwo billions. Relative to 2018, there was an estimated \\n1.2 billion (UI: 0.9–1.4  billion) more people enjoying \\nbetter health and well-being in 2023; this will likely rise \\nto more than 1.5  billion (UI: 1.2–1.8  billion) by 2025. In \\ncontrast, there was only 0.4  billion (UI: 0.4–0.5  billion) \\nmore people in 2023 benefitting from UHC, and only \\n0.6 billion (0.5–0.7  billion) better protected from health \\nemergencies. These figures will likely rise to 0.6  billion \\n(0.5–0.6  billion) and 0.8  billion (UI: 0.6–0.9  billion) by 2025, \\nrespectively – far below the target of one  billion (5). The \\noverall contribution of the UHC billion was disaggregated \\nand the contribution of each underlying tracer indicator \\ncalculated, allowing for precise assessment of the impact \\nof these individual indicators (6).\\n3.1 Healthier populations  billion\\nThe healthier populations (HPOP) billion aims to improve \\npopulation health and well-being by promoting healthier behaviours, lifestyles and environments. Achieving this billion relies on multisectoral intervention through advocacy and changes in public policy and regulation. \\nThe calculation of this billion comprised 21 tracer \\nindicators (including four disaggregated indicators) that \\ncover a wide range of health topics, including clean air, safe water, road safety, tobacco and alcohol consumption, obesity, violence, child nutrition and development.Overall, the world has been progressing steadily towards the HPOP billion target since 2018. This target was \\nachieved in 2023 with 1.2  billion (UI: 0.9–1.4  billion) more \\npeople enjoying better health and well-being compared with 2018. Although this trend was not reversed, progress \\nslowed considerably during the 2020–2022 COVID-19 \\npandemic. The year-to-year change of HPOP contribution \\nwas 407  million from 2018 to 2019, but was only \\n237 million from 2019 to 2020, followed by 198  million \\nin 2021 and 186  million in 2022.

The greatest improvement has been in the South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions. Compared with 2018, in 2023 there were 644  million (UI: \\n536–744  million) and 318  million (UI: 71–503  million) more \\npeople in these two regions, respectively, enjoying better health and well-being, accounting for 53.0% and 26.1% of the global total HPOP contribution, respectively (5).\\nFigure 3.2  HPOP  billion contribution by WHO region, 2019–2025\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n2023\\n2024\\n2025\\n0\\n200\\n400\\n600\\n800\\n1000\\n1200\\n1400\\nContribution (millions)\\nAfrican Region\\nRegion of the Americas\\nSouth-East Asia  Region\\nEuropean Region\\nEastern Mediterranean Region\\nWestern Pacific Region\\nSource : WHO (5).\\nAmong the 21 tracer indicators included in the \\ncomputation of the HPOP  billion, the three indicators \\nwith the greatest contributions are clean fuels, safely \\nmanaged sanitation services and clean air (Fig. 3.3). \\nIn 2019, the shares of these indicators in overall HPOP \\ncontribution were 27.1% (UI: 27.1–27.1%), 24.7% (UI: \\n24.7–24.7%) and 37.5% (UI: 37.5–37.5%), respectively; in \\n2023, they were 38.7% (UI: 36.9–40.5%), 29.8% (UI: 27.6–\\n32.0%) and 17.8% (UI: –4.6 to 35.3%). The indicator that had the least contribution to HPOP was adult obesity: its \\ncontribution was –5.9% (UI: –6.6 to –5.2%) in 2019, and \\n–10.5% (UI: –11.8 to –9.3%) in 2023 (5).\\nThere was considerable heterogeneity in terms of \\ncontributions from tracer indicators across the WHO \\nregions in 2023. Changes in the coverage of clean household fuel contributed positively to the HPOP billion in all but one region. The greatest contribution was seen in the African Region (61.7%, UI: 54.5–69.5%), followed \\nby the South-East Asia (43.7%, UI: 41.3–46.2%), Eastern \\nMediterranean (39.2%, UI: 37.2–41.2%) and Western \\nPacific (37.4%, UI: 34.1–40.8%) regions. In the European Region, the decline in the use of clean household fuels \\nby 2023 caused a negative impact, –36.7% (UI: –47.1 to \\n–25.6%), to the HPOP  billion. The contribution of safely \\nmanaged sanitation was greatest in the Region of the \\nAmericas (49.0%, UI: 45.6–52.1%) followed by the Western \\nPacific Region (44.4%, UI: 39.1–49.7%). For clean air, the contribution was greatest in the European Region \\n(52.2%, UI: 40.8–64.5%), the Eastern Mediterranean Region (31.4%, UI: –4.1 to 64.2%) and the Region of the \\nAmericas (28.9%, UI: 6.3–48.0%), but lowest in the African Region (0.1%, UI: –15.8 to 14.3%). The contribution of \\nsafely managed water was prominent in the African Region, the Region of the Americas and the Eastern \\nProgress towards WHO Triple Billion targets\\n57\\nMediterranean Region, all above 20%. Obesity in adults \\nmade negative contribution across all six regions, which was largest in magnitude in the Region of the Americas (–48.0%, UI: –58.0 to –36.9%), followed by the Eastern Mediterranean Region (–26.0%, UI: –31.2 to –20.6%). \\nObesity in adolescents and children also made a negative \\ncontribution across all six regions, but to a much lower degree (5). Trans-fat regulation and lower road traffic mortality (road deaths) had more noticeable positive contribution in the European Region than in other regions. The impact of tobacco use among adults was salient across all six regions, especially in the European Region (27.7%, UI: \\n27.5–27.8%) and the Region of the Americas (24.6%, UI: \\n24.6–24.8%). Changes in alcohol consumption also led \\nto minor changes in the HPOP  billion, with the greatest \\nimpact found in the African Region (–4.7%, UI: –12.7 to 3.7%) (5).\\nFigure 3.3  Contribution of tracer indicators to the HPOP billion, 2019–2025\\nClean fuel use\\nSanitation service\\nClean air (pm 2.5)\\nTobacco Use\\nSafe water\\nSafe water - rural\\nTrans-fat policy\\nRoad deaths\\nSanitation service - rural\\nAdult obesity\\nAdolescent-child obesity\\nAlcohol consumption\\n407\\n1215\\n1520\\n-250\\n0\\n250\\n500\\n750\\n1000\\n1250\\n1500\\n1750\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n2023\\n2024\\n2025\\nContribution (millions)\\nNet contribution\\nOther indicators below 1% of the total\\nabsolute contribution in 2030\\nChild violence\\nChild development\\nPartner violence\\nChild wasting\\nSanitation service - urban\\nChild overweight\\nSuicide mortality\\nSafe water - urban\\nChild stunting\\nSource : WHO (5).\\n3.2 UHC  billion\\nThe UHC  billion is for improvement in the number of \\npeople having access to essential health services but without inflicting financial hardship. The calculation \\nof progress towards the UHC  billion relied on the \\nassessment of two components: (1)  average service \\ncoverage measured through 14 tracer indicators, and (2)\\n financial hardship measured through an indicator of \\ncatastrophic health spending, defined as the proportion of population whose household expenditure on health is greater than 10% of total household expenditure or income.\\nBy 2023, there were only 429  million more people \\nbenefitting from UHC without incurring catastrophic health spending compared with 2018, not even reaching half of the UHC billion target. The projection for 2025 \\nis a mere 585  million, suggesting that the world is \\nseriously off the mark in achieving the UHC  billion target. \\nThe impact of COVID-19 pandemic was salient, as the \\nUHC  billion reduced or stalled in 2020 and 2021 before \\nreversing the negative trend in 2022. The situation called for accelerated efforts and dramatic changes in public policies to expand UHC (5).\\nAmong the six WHO regions, the Region of the Americas \\nwas the only region where the number of people benefitting from UHC decreased in 2020 and 2021 compared with 2018 (Fig. 3.4). The European Region \\nalso experienced setbacks in the two pandemic years, as \\nshown by the near-zero UHC  billion estimates (5).\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n58\\nFigure 3.4  UHC billions contribution by WHO region, 2019–2025\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n2023\\n2024\\n2025\\n-100\\n0\\n100\\n200\\n300\\n400\\n500\\n600\\nContribution (millions)\\nAfrican Region\\nRegion of the Americas\\nSouth-East Asia  Region\\nEuropean Region\\nEastern Mediterranean Region\\nWestern Pacific Region\\nSource : WHO (5).\\nAmong the tracer indicators included in the calculation \\nof progress for the UHC  billion, receiving HIV treatment, \\na proxy for measuring infectious disease health care, \\ncontributed the most at global level (Fig. 3.5), the contribution of which was over 40% in both 2019 and 2023. By 2023, it had the highest share of contribution in the Region of the Americas (93.1%, UI: 73.5–110.9%), \\nfollowed by the European (76.4%, UI: 61.8–88.7%), \\nWestern Pacific (63.7%, UI: 60.0–66.9%) and Eastern Mediterranean (37.1%, UI: 32.0–42.7%) regions, with the lowest share in the African (16.5%, UI: 15.3–17.6%) and South-East Asia (28.0%, UI: 24.8–31.3%) regions. By 2023, catastrophic health spending made a negative contribution to the UHC billion globally (–7.9%, UI: –8.0 to –7.8%); the magnitude was highest in the Western Pacific (–20.6%, UI: –20.8 to –20.4%) and European (–11.5%, UI: –11.6 to –11.4%) regions. Diabetes, measured by elevated \\nplasma glucose level, contributed negatively to the \\nUHC  billion in all six regions in 2023. However, the impact was minor. Slight regression was also found in 2023 \\nrelative to 2018 with two other indicators – hospital beds density and DTP vaccination (5).\\nBy 2023, changes in health workforce density made \\nlargest negative contribution to the UHC  billion in the \\nRegion of the Americas (–45.4%, UI: –45.7 to –45.0%), \\nwhile making largest positive contribution in the Western Pacific Region (14.9%, UI: 14.8–15.0%). The share of TB treatment was 8.6% (UI: 3.0–18.0%) globally, with the largest share in the South-East Asia Region (16.3%, UI: \\n7.4–23.5%). The contribution of households using basic \\nsanitation facilities was 10.4% (UI: 10.1–10.8%) globally, and highest in the Western Pacific Region (15.5%, UI: 14.7–16.3%). The share of reduced prevalence in tobacco use among adults was 4.2% (UI: 4.1–4.3%) globally; this was largest in the Region of the Americas (15.0%, UI: 14.8–15.1%) and the European Region (10.2%, UI: 10.1–10.3%) (5).\\nProgress towards WHO Triple Billion targets\\n59\\nFigure 3.5  Contribution of tracer indicators to the UHC billion, 2019–2025\\nPopulation change effort\\nHIV treatment\\nPopulation change effort\\nSanitation facility\\nTB treatment\\nHealth workforce density\\nChild health care\\nTobacco control\\nPrenatal care\\nHypertension treatment\\nFamily planning\\nMalaria prevention\\nCatastrophic health spending\\nDiabetes management\\n111\\n429\\n585\\n-100\\n0\\n100\\n200\\n300\\n400\\n500\\n600\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n2023\\n2024\\n2025\\nContribution (millions)\\nNet contribution\\nChild immunization\\nHospital bed density\\nOther indicators below 1% of the total absolute contribution in 2030\\nSource : WHO (5).\\n3.3 Health emergencies \\nprotection billion\\nThe health emergencies protection (HEP) billion aims \\nto have one  billion more people better protected from \\nhealth emergencies. The index for this  billion was \\ncalculated based on SDG 3 by measuring three indices: \\n(i) emergency preparation, (ii) emergency prevention, and  \\n(iii) emergency detection and responses.\\nAt the global level, there has been consistent \\nimprovement in the HEP  billion since 2018 (Fig. 3.6). \\nHowever, such progress is still not sufficient to achieve \\nthe HEP  billion target by 2025. Progress towards the HEP  billion even stalled or regressed in 2020 and 2021 \\nin multiple WHO regions. The Region of the Americas saw a downward trend starting from 2020 that extended \\nthrough 2023. The improvement in the HEP  billion was \\nrelatively small in the Western Pacific, European and Eastern Mediterranean regions compared with other \\nregions. Most of the improvement in the HEP  billion \\nbetween 2018 and 2025 will come from the WHO African and the South-East Asia regions (5).\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n60\\nFigure 3.6  Contributions to the HEP billion by WHO region, 2019–2025\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n2023\\n2024\\n2025\\n-100\\n0\\n100\\n200\\n300\\n400\\n500\\n600\\n700\\n800\\nContribtuion (million)\\nAfrican Region\\nRegion of the Americas\\nSouth-East Asia  Region\\nEuropean Region\\nEastern Mediterranean Region\\nWestern Pacific Region\\nSource : WHO (5).\\n3.4 Health-related SDGs and health \\ninformation system\\nThe Triple Billion targets leverage the global and national \\ncommitments to meet the health-related SDGs. Given the centrality of the health-related SDGs in the Triple Billion \\ntarget construct, the Triple Billion target projections \\nallow WHO and its Member States to assess their progress towards the 2030 targets for SDG indicators.\\nThe projected Triple Billion progress since 2019, the first \\nyear of the GPW13, showed that significant progress has \\nbeen achieved for all three of the billions, particularly the HPOP billion as the world has likely already achieved the \\ntarget of having one  billion more people living healthier \\nlives by 2023 (Fig. 3.7). However, such progress is far from sufficient to ensure the health-related SDG targets are achieved globally. Figure 3.7 illustrates the gap between Triple Billion projections based on current trends and an alternative scenario where hypothetical annualized rate of changes at the country level are applied such that each SDG indicator target is met by 2030 (5).\\nIf current trajectories hold, relative to 2018, some \\n1.5 billion more people will live healthier lives by 2025, \\nand 2.0  billion by 2030. However, the figure would be \\n3.3 billion by 2025 and 5.6  billion by 2030 if the world \\nmeets all global indicator targets. Meeting the global \\ntargets annually would also mean 1.0  billion more \\npeople having access to essential health services \\nwithout incurring catastrophic health spending by 2025 \\ninstead of 0.6  billion under the current trajectory, and an \\nadditional 0.9  billion people safeguarded against health \\nemergencies instead of 0.8  billion (5).\\nProgress towards WHO Triple Billion targets\\n61\\nFigure 3.7  Triple Billion target contribution scenario by achieving health-related SDGs\\n777\\n869\\n905\\n879\\n1000\\n1045\\n1520\\n1852\\n2001\\n3341\\n4874\\n5608\\n585\\n780\\n892\\n966\\n1591\\n2071\\nHealth emergencies protection\\nHealthier populations\\nUniversal health coverage\\n2018\\n2022\\n2025\\n2028\\n2030\\n2018\\n2022\\n2025\\n2028\\n2030\\n2018\\n2022\\n2025\\n2028\\n2030\\n0\\n500\\n1000\\n1500\\n2000\\n0\\n2000\\n4000\\n0\\n300\\n600\\n900\\nNumber of people (millions)\\nKey: main line and circles: actual numbers and projections; shaded areas: confidence intervals for projections; orange lines: progress required to reach the  \\nSDG targets.\\nSource: WHO (5).\\nThe world needs to intensify efforts to achieve the health-\\nrelated SDG targets by 2030, which is vital for building healthier, more equitable and prosperous societies globally. For such efforts, timely and accurate monitoring of the progress based on robust data is vital for effective \\npolicy changes and interventions.\\nHowever, lack of timely reporting and delay in producing \\nhealth estimates using the most recent empirical data \\ncould bring great challenges in delivering accurate assessment for many health outcomes. \\nFigure 3.8 shows the percentage of UHC service coverage \\nindex tracers for which primary data were available for years 2017–2021. It is evident that most indicators suffered from a data shortage at various degrees across countries. A lot could be done to enhance the data input for the Triple Billion computation. More often than not, the lack of data will not be limited to the data required by the Triple Billion; rather, it is deeply entrenched in \\npoorly performing health information systems. Thus, efforts should be made to strengthen the general health \\ninformation systems in countries to generate reliable data for the effective tracking of and policy changes regarding health-related SDGs.\\nWHO is committed to work with Member States to \\nstrengthen their system capacity to collect, analyse and use health data. Various tools have been developed by \\nWHO to enhance countries’ data capacity. For example, \\nthe WHO SCORE for health data technical package was designed to assess the performance of national health information systems, identify the data gaps and provide a toolbox to improve various areas of a functioning health information system (7). The Data management competency framework (DMCF) developed by the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific is another example of such a tool; it enables health information \\nmanagers to identify capacity gaps and drive competency \\ndevelopment at various levels (Box 3.1).\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n62\\nFigure 3.8  Percentage of UHC service coverage index tracers for which primary data were available for years  \\n2017–2021\\nSource : WHO and World Bank (8).\\nBox 3.1  Strategic and integrated capacity-building of the health information workforce \\nin the Western Pacific Region\\nStrategic use of data for decision-making is critical for measuring and driving progress towards global and \\nnational health indicator targets. Capacity limitations of health information workers (HIW) often hinder the \\nability to effectively produce and use health data, despite significant improvements in health information systems. HIWs often do not possess the required capacities to participate consistently and in a timely manner in the data management cycle. To systematically assess such capacity gaps, the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific, with support from WHO headquarters, country offices and in collaboration with partner \\norganizations, launched the DMCF in May 2023 (9) . This framework is a comprehensive, integrated and coherent \\ntool that can be used to define and assess current and future competency needs of HIWs across the region and \\nbeyond. This tool will enable health information managers in countries to identify capacity gaps and plan and drive the competency development of their HIWs across different levels of their health system.\\nPapua New Guinea has set out a clear path as the first country to adopt the framework. As a direct outcome of a \\nnational health information workshop held in October 2022, Papua New Guinea National Department of Health collaborated with WHO to establish a standardized set of competencies required for health information positions at both national and provincial levels based on the ideally required skills and competencies spelled out in the WHO DMCF. These competency profiles are invaluable as they provide a clear foundation for developing tools to assess training needs and formulating comprehensive, long-term capacity-building strategies. The national data management competency profiles were officially launched together with the Provincial Health Authority \\nMonitoring & Evaluation toolkit in September 2023.\\nChina followed suit by identifying the framework’s value in improving health information workforce capacity in \\na systematic and sustainable manner. The Center for Health Statistics and Information of the National Health \\nCommission of China collaborated with WHO in translating the framework into Chinese and conducted a series of workshops at both national and provincial levels in preparation for conducting competency gap assessments among different types of health workers across different provinces.\\nThe adoption of the framework in Papua New Guinea and China serves as pivotal examples, highlighting how the \\nWHO DMCF could be applied to each Member State’s unique context. This ability to contextualize and apply the framework is essential, given the diverse nature of Member States’ health information systems and their diverse priorities and needs in addressing both present and future health challenges.\\nProgress towards WHO Triple Billion targets\\n63\\n3.5 Conclusion\\nThe WHO Triple Billion is a framework and a strategy \\naiming to drive timely improvement of global health. The targets, although set at the global level, were simply the aggregation of country-level estimates that were calculated based on underlying tracer indicators. \\nThe Triple Billion projections provide WHO, its Member \\nStates and partners with the much-needed assessment of progress towards fulfilling their commitment on Triple Billion targets and the health-related SDGs. Tracer indicators are the cornerstone of the Triple Billion targets, but also a critical tool for countries to identify and prioritize strategies to enhance the health of their populations. By examining the projected contributions at indicator level, policy-makers can make informed course adjustments to achieve the SDGs set by the \\nglobal community.As the GPW13 is drawing to a close in 2025, continuous \\ntracking of the Triple  Billion targets and a proper \\ntransition from GPW13 to GPW14 is vital for WHO to \\nensure accountability, adaptability and efficiency in achieving the ambitious goals it set jointly with its Member States. All three levels of WHO – headquarters, regional and country offices – should make every effort \\nto align their priorities. Through these priorities that \\nwill be reflected in the new programmatic and outcome indicators for the upcoming GPW14, WHO will reaffirm its commitment to address evolving global health needs, enhance collaboration with stakeholders and strengthen its role in advancing global health equity and security. Committed investment in improving data and health information systems across the globe will be essential for \\nsuch endeavours.\\nReferences\\n1.

This chapter looks \\nat selected key global health issues, such as the double burden \\nof malnutrition, where undernutrition coexists in parallel with overweight and obesity globally. It also highlights the health \\nchallenges faced by persons with disabilities, and refugees and \\ninternational migrants.4.1 The double burden \\nof malnutrition\\nCombating malnutrition in all its forms is one of the \\ngreatest global health challenges. Today, the world faces the double burden of malnutrition, characterized by the coexistence of undernutrition along with overweight and obesity within individuals, households and populations, \\nand across the life course. This section highlights the \\nglobal and regional trends in the population-level burden of stunting, wasting and overweight among \\nchildren under 5  years of age, and the double burden \\nof thinness or underweight and obesity among older children, adolescents and adults. Box 4.1 summarizes the definitions of the indicators of malnutrition used in this section.\\nChild stunting stems from poor nutrition during \\npregnancy and early childhood. It can lead to severe physical and cognitive damage that may last a lifetime. \\nA child who is moderately or severely wasted (due to \\nrecent rapid weight loss or a failure to gain weight) has an increased risk of death. In contrast, a child may be overweight due to excessive caloric intake, which may be due to poor access to nutritious foods, consumption of nutrient-poor ultra-processed foods and/or inadequate physical activity.\\nIn childhood and adolescence, obesity is associated \\nwith greater risks and earlier onset of various NCDs, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In addition, children and teenagers living with obesity may experience psychosocial consequences from stigma, discrimination and bullying. Undernutrition, as measured by thinness among children aged 5–19 \\nyears, lowers learning potential, weakens the immune \\nsystem, and increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Micronutrient deficiencies and anaemia in adolescent girls amplify the risk of life-threatening complications during pregnancy and childbirth.\\nIn adults, obesity is associated with increased risk of \\nmorbidity and mortality from a variety of NCDs, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, neurological disorders, chronic respiratory diseases and digestive disorders. Undernutrition in adults, as captured by the underweight indicator, is critical for adult women during \\npregnancy, with repercussions for both mother and child. \\nIn older adults, undernutrition can lead to increased risk of impaired immune response, and physical and cognitive impairment. In turn, ageing brings physiological changes with sensory impairment, poor oral health, isolation, loneliness and depression, which further exacerbate the risk of undernutrition.\\nBox 4.1  Definitions of metrics and measures used in this section\\nFor children under 5  years of age:\\n• Stunting: height-for-age lower than 2 standard deviations below WHO Child Growth Standards median\\n• Wasting: weight-for-height lower than 2 standard deviations below WHO Child Growth Standards median\\n• Overweight: weight-for-height greater than 2 standard deviations above WHO Child Growth \\nStandards median.\\nFor children and adolescents aged 5–19 years:\\n• Thinness: BMI-for-age lower than 2 standard deviations below the WHO Growth Reference median\\n• Obesity: BMI-for-age greater than 2 standard deviations above the WHO Growth Reference median.\\nFor adults aged 18 years and older:\\n• Underweight: BMI less than 18.5\\n• Obesity: BMI greater than or equal to 30.\\nBMI: body mass index, calculated as weight (kg)/height² (m²).\\nCrude prevalence is used for children and adolescents aged 0–19 years, and age-standardized prevalence is used \\nfor adults aged 18 years and older.\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n66\\n4.1.1  The magnitude of \\nthe problem\\nIn 2022, an estimated 148  million (UI: 144–152  million) \\nchildren under 5  years of age globally were affected \\nby stunting (too short for age) and 45  million (UI: 36–\\n54 million) were affected by wasting (too thin for height), \\nrevealing the vast extent of undernutrition among the \\nyoungest population. However, an estimated 37  million \\n(UI: 34–41  million) children under 5  years of age were \\noverweight in 2022 (1).\\nIn the same year, among older children and adolescents \\naged 5–19 years, an estimated 190  million (UI: 180–\\n200 million) were living with thinness, while 160  million \\n(UI: 150–170  million) were living with obesity. Among \\nadults aged 20 years and older, an estimated 350  million \\nwere underweight, while 880  million were living with \\nobesity. This means that over one  billion people aged \\n5 years and older worldwide are living with obesity, while \\nover half a billion others are living with underweight or \\nthinness (2).\\nThese numbers, along with the health implications \\ndescribed above, indicate that the world is dealing with a public health problem not only at a massive scale but also a complex one.4.1.2  Stunting, wasting and \\noverweight among \\nchildren under 5  years \\nof age\\nUndernutrition among children under 5  years of \\nage globally, as reflected by the number affected by \\nstunting and wasting, has declined in the past three decades. The number affected by stunting declined from \\n259 million (UI: 252–266  million) in 1990 to 148  million \\n(UI: 144–152  million) in 2022. Over the same period, the \\nnumber affected by wasting declined from 59  million \\n(UI: 54–64  million) to 45  million (UI: 36–54  million), and \\nthe number of overweight rose from 32  million (UI: \\n30–35  million) to 37  million (UI: 34–41  million) (1).\\nThe global prevalence of stunting (SDG indicator 2.2.1) almost halved from 40.2% (UI: 39.1–41.3%) in 1990 to 22.3% (UI: 21.8–22.9%) in 2022, and the prevalence of wasting (SDG indicator 2.2.2) declined by 26%, from 9.2% (UI: 8.4–10.0%) to 6.8% (UI: 5.5–8.1%). However, the prevalence of overweight (SDG indicator 2.2.2) increased \\nby 12% from 5.0% (UI: 4.6–5.4%) to 5.6% (UI: 5.1–6.1%) \\nduring the same period (Fig. 4.1) (1).\\nFigure 4.1  Prevalence of stunting, wasting and overweight among children under 5  years of age, globally and by \\nWHO region, 1990–2022\\nGlobal\\nAfrican Region\\nRegion of the \\nAmericas\\nSouth-East Asia \\nRegion\\nEuropean Region\\nEastern \\nMediterranean Region\\nWestern Pacific\\nRegion\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\nPrevalence (%)\\nStunting\\nWasting\\nOverweight\\nStunting\\nWasting\\nOverweight\\nStunting\\nWasting\\nOverweight\\nStunting\\nWasting\\nOverweight\\nStunting\\nOverweight\\nStunting\\nWasting\\nOverweight\\nStunting\\nWasting\\nOverweight\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\nPrevalence (%)\\n(2022)\\nPrevalence of stunting among children under 5 years of age\\nPrevalence of wasting among children under 5 years of age\\nPrevalence of overweight among children under 5 years of age\\nWestern Pacific\\nRegion\\nGlobal\\nAfrican Region\\nEuropean\\nRegiona\\nEastern \\nMediterranean Region\\nRegion of the \\nAmericas\\nSouth-East Asia \\nRegion\\n a No dat a for wasting for European region.\\nSource: WHO et al. (1).\\nKey issues and trends in global health\\n67\\nAt this pace of change, the world is off-track to meet \\nthe 2030 global targets to halve the number of children \\nunder 5  years of age affected by stunting (from the 2012 \\nbaseline) and to reduce the prevalence of wasting and overweight to less than 3% (1, 3).\\nAlmost all WHO regions are experiencing a considerable \\nburden of both undernutrition (in the form of stunting and wasting) and overweight among the youngest population. In the South-East Asia Region, the prevalence of overweight nearly doubled in the past three decades, \\nreaching 3.8% (UI: 3.1–4.6%) in 2022, while the prevalence \\nof wasting continued to be the highest across all WHO regions despite having declined from 17.1% (UI: 13.6–21.3%) in 1990 to 14.7% (UI: 11.0–19.3%) in 2022. This means that in 2022 almost one in five (18.5%) children in this region were either too thin or too heavy for their height. In addition, three out of 10 (30.1%, UI: 28.3–32.0%) children were affected by stunting, even though its prevalence had halved since 1990 when it stood at 60.5% (UI: 57.5–63.5%) (Fig. 4.1) (1).\\nIn the Eastern Mediterranean Region, approximately the \\nsame proportion of children were affected by wasting (6.9%, UI: 5.4–8.7%) and overweight (6.3%, UI: 5.2–7.7%) in 2022, while a quarter (25.1%, UI: 23.4–26.8%) of all \\nchildren under 5  years of age were affected by stunting. \\nThe Region of the Americas had the highest prevalence of overweight (8.5%, UI: 7.4–9.7%) across all WHO regions in 2022, and very low prevalence of wasting (0.8%, UI: 0.3–1.9%). However, about one in 11 (9.2%, UI: 8.7–9.6%) children in this region were affected by stunting that year \\n(Fig. 4.1). Peru is notable, both regionally and globally, for \\na massive reduction in stunting prevalence (Box 4.2) (1).\\nBox 4.2  A dramatic reduction in childhood stunting in Peru\\nSince 2000, few countries have reduced the prevalence of stunting among children under 5 years of age as \\ndramatically as Peru. It is estimated to have declined from a very high prevalence of 31.1% (UI: 29.4–32.8%) in 2000, to 10.1% (UI: 9.5–10.8%) in 2022, which is considered a medium prevalence. The ARR (5.5% per year) substantially surpasses that in the Region of the Americas (2.0% per year) as well as in the upper-middle-income countries (3.1% per year) (Fig. 4.2) ( 1).\\nAn analysis of drivers of the decline in stunting prevalence in Peru from 2000 to 2016 identified multiple determinants of stunting reduction, including socioeconomic class, parental education, parental health, and differences in maternal and newborn health care. Reducing the equity gap contributed greatly to this reduction, \\nwith the greatest reductions observed in the lowest wealth quintile, in rural areas and among children with the \\nleast-educated mothers. The slope index of inequality, a measure of absolute wealth-related inequality, indicates that the gap in stunting prevalence among children under 5 years of age between the richest and poorest households reduced by half between 2000 and 2016, leading to greater equity. Peru’s experience offers useful lessons in tackling the problem of stunting with the participation of multiple sectors ( 4).\\nFigure 4.2  Prevalence of stunting among children under 5  years of age in Peru, WHO Region of the \\nAmericas, and upper-middle-income countries, 2000–2022\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\n35\\n2000\\n2001\\n2002\\n2003\\n2004\\n2005\\n2006\\n2007\\n2008\\n2009\\n2010\\n2011\\n2012\\n2013\\n2014\\n2015\\n2016\\n2017\\n2018\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\nPrevalence (%)\\nPeru\\nRegion of the Americas\\nUpper-middle-income countries\\nSource : WHO et al. (1).\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n68\\n4.1.3  Thinness and obesity \\namong children and \\nadolescents aged \\n5–19  years\\nGlobally in 1990, an estimated 220  million (UI: \\n210–230  million) children and adolescents aged 5–19 \\nyears were living with thinness and 31  million (UI: \\n29–34  million) were living with obesity. In 2022, the \\ncorresponding numbers were 190  million (UI: 180–\\n200 million) and 160  million (UI: 150–170  million). This \\nmeans that from 1990 to 2022, the numbers of children \\nand adolescents in this age group living with obesity \\nincreased by 130  million, while the number living with \\nthinness decreased by just 30  million (2).\\nGlobally, the estimated combined prevalence of thinness and obesity among children and adolescents aged 5–19 years increased from 15.5% in 1990 to 17.8% in 2022. Thinness was dominant in the double burden of malnutrition in this age group in 1990, with a prevalence     of 13.5% (UI: 12.9–14.2%) (compare obesity: 1.9%, UI: 1.8–2.1%). Obesity prevalence quadrupled to reach 8.2% (UI: 7.7–8.8%) in 2022, only slightly lower than the prevalence of thinness in that year (9.6%, UI: 8.9–10.3%) (Fig. 4.3) (2).\\nAmong WHO regions, the Region of the Americas saw \\nthe largest increase in the double burden of malnutrition among children and adolescents aged 5–19 years since 1990. This was driven by the rise in obesity, which tripled to 17.0% (UI: 15.6–18.3%) in 2022, while thinness \\nprevalence decreased only slightly from 2.9% (UI: \\n2.5–3.5%) to 2.1% (UI: 1.9–2.4%). The Western Pacific Region also experienced a large increase in the double burden, as the obesity prevalence increased almost tenfold to reach 10.8% (UI: 9.1–12.7%) in 2022, largely overtaking the dominance of thinness. The South-East Asia Region was the only region where the double burden decreased, as thinness prevalence fell sharply from 29.9% (UI: 28.1–31.7%) to 18.2% (UI: 16.3–20.1%); however, the \\nregion continued to have the highest thinness prevalence \\nwhile obesity prevalence increased at an alarming rate from 0.3% (UI: 0.3–0.5%) in 1990 to 4.6% (UI: 3.9–5.5%) in 2022 (Fig. 4.3) (2). \\nFigure 4.3  Prevalence of thinness and overweight among children and adolescents aged 5–19 years, globally and \\nby WHO region, 1990–2022\\n1990\\n1991\\n1992\\n1993\\n1994\\n1995\\n1996\\n1997\\n1998\\n1999\\n2000\\n2001\\n2002\\n2003\\n2004\\n2005\\n2006\\n2007\\n2008\\n2009\\n2010\\n2011\\n2012\\n2013\\n2014\\n2015\\n2016\\n2017\\n2018\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\nPrevalence (%)\\nGlobal\\nAfrican Region\\nRegion of the Americas\\nSouth-East Asia Region\\nEuropean Region\\nEastern Mediterranean Region\\nWestern Pacific Region\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\nPrevalence (%)\\nPrevalence of overweight among children and adolescents aged 5–19 years\\nPrevalence of thinness among children and adolescents aged 5–19 years\\nSource: NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (2).\\nKey issues and trends in global health\\n69\\nFigure 4.4  Prevalence of underweight and obesity among adults aged 18 years and older, globally and by WHO \\nregion, 1990–2022\\n1990\\n1991\\n1992\\n1993\\n1994\\n1995\\n1996\\n1997\\n1998\\n1999\\n2000\\n2001\\n2002\\n2003\\n2004\\n2005\\n2006\\n2007\\n2008\\n2009\\n2010\\n2011\\n2012\\n2013\\n2014\\n2015\\n2016\\n2017\\n2018\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\nPrevalence (%)\\nGlobal\\nAfrican Region\\nRegion of the Americas\\nSouth-East Asia Region\\nEuropean Region\\nEastern Mediterranean Region\\nWestern Pacific Region\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\nPrevalence (%)\\nPrevalence of overweight among children and adolescents aged 5–19 years\\nPrevalence of underweight among adults aged 18 years and older\\nSource: NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (2).4.1.4  Underweight and \\nobesity among  \\nadults aged 18 years \\nand older\\nIn 1990, globally an estimated 490  million (UI: 470–\\n500 million) adults aged 18 years and older were living \\nwith underweight, while 200  million (UI: 190–200  million) \\nwere living with obesity. Between 1990 and 2022, the \\nnumber of adults aged 18 years and older living with \\nobesity increased dramatically by almost 700  million, \\nreaching 890  million (UI: 870–920  million), while the \\nnumber living with underweight decreased by 90  million \\nto 400  million (UI: 370–420  million) (2).\\nGlobally, the combined age-standardized prevalence of \\nunderweight and obesity among adults aged 18  years \\nand older increased from 21.1% in 1990 to 23.0% in 2022. This increase has been driven by the rise in obesity, the age-standardized prevalence of which more than doubled from 6.6% (UI: 6.4–6.8%) in 1990 to 15.8% (UI: 15.4–16.2%) in 2022. The age-standardized prevalence of \\nunderweight halved in the same period, from 14.5% (UI: \\n14.1–15.0%) in 1990 to 7.2% (UI: 6.8–7.7%) in 2022. This means that obesity has taken over the dominance in the double burden of malnutrition among adults globally in the past three decades (Fig. 4.4) (2).Obesity prevalence among adults aged 18 years and older \\nincreased in all WHO regions. The Region of the Americas \\nand the Eastern Mediterranean Region have experienced the largest absolute increase in obesity prevalence since 1990, leading to the highest obesity prevalence across WHO regions in 2022, affecting one third of adults in the Region of the Americas and almost three in 10 in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. In the European Region, the 8.9 percentage point increase in the double burden was due entirely to the rise in obesity prevalence, as \\nthinness prevalence remained low. About half of the \\ndouble burden in the African Region was due to obesity in 2022, up from about one fifth in 1990. The Western Pacific Region remained the region with the lowest combined prevalence of underweight and obesity among adults, but obesity is becoming dominant. Underweight prevalence decreased markedly in the South-East Asia Region from 36.5% (UI: 35.0–37.9%) in 1990 to 12.7% (UI: 11.5–14.0%) in 2022, driving the only decrease of the double burden among adults across all WHO regions. \\nHowever, underweight remained highly prevalent among \\nadults, while obesity prevalence increased eightfold since 1990 to reach 8.0% (UI: 7.4–8.6%) in 2022 (Fig. 4.4) (2).\\nObesity prevalence tends to differ among men and \\nwomen, and this difference also varies across regions and \\nover time.

In 2022, obesity prevalence among women was a third or 4.3 percentage points higher among women (17.9%; UI: 17.3–18.5%) than among men (13.6%; UI: 13.0–14.2%) (Fig 4.5) (2) .\\nDifferent patterns are observed across the six WHO regions. The Region of the Americas and the Eastern Mediterranean Region demonstrated large increases in obesity prevalence among both men and women. The Eastern Mediterranean Region consistently demonstrated the largest absolute sex-related inequalities in obesity over the past three decades (difference of 12.4 percentage points between women and men in 2022). In the \\nAfrican and South-East Asia regions, obesity prevalence increased faster among women than men, leading to an \\nincrease in sex-related absolute inequalities over time (differences of 10.2 and 5.1 percentage points between women and men in the African and South-East Asia regions in 2022, respectively). Conversely, in the European and Western Pacific regions, obesity prevalence increased faster among men than women leading to no sex-related inequalities in 2022 (Fig 4.5 ) (2) .\\nFigure 4.5  Age-standardized obesity prevalence among adults aged 18 years and older, by sex, globally and \\nby WHO region, 1990–2022\\n1990\\n1991\\n1992\\n1993\\n1994\\n1995\\n1996\\n1997\\n1998\\n1999\\n2000\\n2001\\n2002\\n2003\\n2004\\n2005\\n2006\\n2007\\n2008\\n2009\\n2010\\n2011\\n2012\\n2013\\n2014\\n2015\\n2016\\n2017\\n2018\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\nAge-standardized prevalence (%)\\nGlobal\\nAfrican Region\\nRegion of the Americas\\nSouth-East Asia Region\\nEuropean Region\\nWestern Pacific Region\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n1990\\n1994\\n1998\\n2002\\n2006\\n2010\\n2014\\n2018\\n2022\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\nAge-standardized prevalence (%)\\nFemale\\nMale\\nEastern Mediterranean \\nRegion\\nShaded areas represent 95% uncertainty intervals. \\nSource: NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (2) .  \\nKey issues and trends in global health\\n71\\n4.1.5  Double-duty actions \\nto tackle the double \\nburden of malnutrition\\nThe coexistence of undernutrition, overweight and \\nobesity can be addressed by taking advantage of the shared drivers across forms of malnutrition, including biological, environmental and social factors, to design and implement policies and programmes using a life-\\ncourse, multi-generational approach. These double-\\nduty actions are evidence-based, efficient and effective interventions that can make the most of often limited time, fiscal and human resources. Common delivery platforms that can be leveraged for double-duty actions include national dietary guidelines, health systems, urban food systems, humanitarian settings and social policies (5–7).\\nDouble-duty actions need not necessarily be new \\nactions. Rather, policy-makers can capitalize on existing government buy-in and resources, by reviewing and \\nrefocusing existing food and agriculture policies. \\nThey often already exist to address single forms of malnutrition, but need to be refocused to address multiple forms simultaneously. Strong opportunities for double-duty actions include the following examples: school feeding programmes that focus only on addressing undernutrition or overweight can be redesigned to ensure that they instead provide and promote a healthy diet; scaling up the WHO antenatal care recommendations; protecting and promoting breastfeeding; revising complementary feeding \\nguidelines and educating care-givers on the risks of \\nunhealthy complementary foods; designing social support and welfare programmes to reduce risks from unhealthy foods; and ensuring that food systems and food environment policies facilitate the purchase and consumption of a healthy diet by increasing access to and attractiveness of nutritious foods. \\nNutrition and food safety are closely interlinked and \\nessential for achieving positive health outcomes from food systems. There is a linkage between subclinical infection with enteropathogens and stunting (8, 9). \\nFood must be safe, available, accessible, nutritious, \\nculturally acceptable and ingested regularly to ensure growth, health and well-being. Unsafe food increases infection and intoxication, creating a vicious cycle of disease, malnutrition and disability, particularly affecting vulnerable groups.\\n4.2 Disability-related \\nhealth inequities\\nDisability results from the interaction between health \\nconditions and/or impairments that a person experiences, such as dementia, blindness or spinal cord injury, and a range of contextual factors related to different environmental and personal factors including societal \\nattitudes, access to infrastructure, discriminatory policies, \\npoverty, age and gender. This understanding of disability is grounded in the WHO International classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF), published in 2001 (10).\\nAccording to the WHO Global report on health equity for \\npersons with disabilities\\n, approximately 1.3  billion persons \\nin 2021 – about 16% of the global population – had disability. The global number of persons with disabilities has increased substantially in the past decade due to demographic and epidemiological changes such as population growth and the increase in the number of persons with NCDs who are living longer and ageing with limitations in functioning (11).\\nPersons with disabilities often experience health \\ninequities due to avoidable, unjust and unfair conditions. \\nThey die younger, have poorer health and increased disease risk, and more limitations in their everyday functioning. The contributing factors to these inequities \\ncan be (i) health-system-related factors, such as barriers \\nin physical infrastructure and communication, negative attitudes by health workers or lack of disability data in the health information system; (ii) structural factors, such as stigma and discrimination; (iii) social determinants, such as poverty and lack of education; and (iv) disease risk factors such as tobacco consumption and obesity.\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n72\\n4.2.1  Premature mortality \\namong persons \\nwith disabilities\\nData on health inequities in terms of premature mortality \\namong persons with disabilities are scarce. However, a growing body of evidence indicates that persons with disabilities have higher rates of premature mortality compared with persons without disabilities (11). A \\nsystematic review of 70 studies from 22 low- and middle-\\nincome countries found that persons with disabilities have double the mortality rates of persons without disabilities (12). Premature mortality is even more visible in those that are most marginalized among persons with disabilities. For example, evidence from some high-income European countries shows that persons with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities have higher risks of premature mortality compared with the general population (13–16). The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated \\nthis pattern. A systematic review of 56 studies found \\nthat persons with disabilities were almost three times as likely to die from COVID-19 than persons without disabilities (17).4.2.2  Poorer health and \\nhigher disease risk \\namong persons \\nwith disabilities\\nPersons with disabilities have in general poorer \\nhealth and higher risk of developing secondary health conditions (11). Data from across 31 European countries collected via the European Health Interview Survey in 2019 show that, overall, compared with persons without \\ndisability, persons with severe disability are more likely \\nto report having NCDs, including chronic respiratory diseases (over eight times as likely), coronary heart disease or angina pectoris (12 times as likely); stroke (28 times as likely); diabetes (almost six times as likely); and depression (over eight times as likely). The gap in the self-reported morbidity between persons with and without disability varies greatly across the 31 European countries, but morbidity remains consistently higher among persons with disabilities (Fig. 4.6) (18).\\nFigure 4.6  Inequality in self-reported NCDs and risk factors between persons with severe disability and persons \\nwith no disability across 31 European countries, 2019\\nCategory\\nindicator\\nDiﬀerence\\nRatio\\nSubgroup\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\nEstimate (%)\\nNCDs\\nPersons with chronic lower respiratory \\ndiseases (excluding asthma) (%)\\n11.4\\n8.6\\nNo disability\\nSevere disability\\nPersons with coronary heart disease or \\nangina pectoris (%)\\n12.5\\n12.4\\nNo disability\\nSevere disability\\nPersons with stroke or chronic \\nconsequences of stroke (%)\\n8.2\\n28.3\\nNo disability\\nSevere disability\\nPersons with diabetes (%)\\n17.8\\n5.8\\nNo disability\\nSevere disability\\nPersons with chronic depression (%)\\n22.8\\n8.6\\nNo disability\\nSevere disability\\nNCD risk\\nfactor\\nPersons with high blood pressure (%)\\n34.8\\n3.4\\nNo disability\\nSevere disability\\nPersons who are obese (body mass index [BMI] \\nequal to or greater than 30) (%)\\n15.6\\n2.0\\nNo disability\\nSevere disability\\nPerforming health-enhancing aerobic \\nphysical activity at least once a week (%)\\n–22.1\\n0.3\\nNo disability\\nSevere disability\\nDaily consumption of 1-4 portions of fruit \\nand vegetables (%)\\n–1.8\\n1.0\\nNo disability\\nSevere disability\\nNotes: circles indicate countries – each country is represented by multiple circles (one for each indicator and each subgroup).

In terms of health-system factors, lack of accessible and inclusive health service provision often leaves persons \\nwith disabilities behind. A systematic review of 29 \\nstudies from eight high-income countries found that women with disabilities are 22% less likely to have been screened for breast cancer and 33% less likely to have been screened for cervical cancer than their non-disabled peers (19). Data from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in 28 countries show that children with disabilities are generally at greater risk of missing out on vaccinations: \\nonly 44% of children aged 24–35  months with more  \\nthan one functional difficulty are fully vaccinated, compared with 58% of children at the same age without disabilities (20).\\nEvidence from 37 countries shows that persons with \\ndisabilities have lower access to health services than those without disabilities (Fig. 4.7). Across these countries, the median estimate shows that persons with \\ndisabilities are more than four times as likely as persons \\nwithout disabilities to be unable to get health care when they need it: 9% of persons with disabilities versus 2% of persons without disabilities indicated that they needed but could not get health care. In eight countries, more than 20% of persons with disabilities were not able to get health care when they needed it (21, 22). In European countries, costs of services, geographical location \\nand long waiting lists, which disproportionately affect \\npersons with disabilities, are major factors in the lower access to health services.\\nBeyond health-system factors, persons with disabilities \\nare also more likely to have risk factors for ill health. Data from 31 European countries show that, compared with persons without disabilities, persons with severe disabilities are overall three times as likely to self-report having high blood pressure, twice as likely to be obese and a third as likely to do regular aerobic physical activity (Fig. 4.6) (18). Very often, the reason for the higher risk \\nfactor presence in persons with disabilities is the lack of \\naccessible health promotion and prevention strategies, which do not allow this population to benefit equally (11).\\nDifferent social determinants also play an important \\nrole as factors that drive health inequities among persons with disabilities. Poverty is a solid example to demonstrate this. Poor living conditions and social exclusion add to the risk of poor health and unmet health-care needs among persons with disabilities. Across 36 European countries, 77.7% of persons with severe disabilities were at risk of poverty before social transfers \\n(such as benefits, allowances and pensions), compared \\nwith 35.2% of persons with no disability. Yet even after social transfers, poverty risk is still double among persons with disabilities (24.4%, compared with 13.4%) (Fig. 4.8). In nine countries, there was little or no disability-related \\ninequity in poverty risk (≤  5 percentage points difference), \\nyet in the remaining countries the gap ranged up to 35.7 percentage points (18, 21).\\nFigure 4.7  Percentage of persons who needed but could not get health care, by disability status, in 37 \\ncountries, 2015–2021\\nIndicator\\nDiﬀerence\\nRatio\\nSubgroup\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\n35\\n40\\nEstimate (%)\\nSelf-reported unmet needs for \\nhealth care (%)\\n7\\n4.5\\nNo disability\\nSome or severe disability\\nNotes: circles indicate countries – each country is represented by multiple circles (one for each indicator and each subgroup).

According \\nto the analysis from 36 European countries, persons \\nwith severe disability are overall twice as likely to report having unmet health-care needs due to financial limitations than persons with no disability. They are also almost twice as likely to be unable to meet unexpected financial expenses (e.g. having surgery or repairing their house), more likely to be overburdened by housing costs and four times as likely to be living in conditions with\\n1  SDG indicator 5.2.1. See section 2.2.5 for global data.severe material deprivation (Fig. 4.8). Gaps in formal social support mechanisms may mean that persons with disabilities are reliant on family members for support to engage in health activities and support for their mental health; yet the proportion of persons who felt they had  \\nstrong social support was overall 10  percentage points \\nlower among persons with severe disabilities (18, 21). \\nEvidence also suggests that, compared with persons \\nwithout disabilities, persons with disabilities are at greater risk of violence, including IPV,\\n1 but significant \\ndata gaps remain.

Evidence is also emerging from low- and middle-income \\ncountries. For example, analysis of data from seven violence-prevention programmes in low- and middle-income countries indicated that women with disabilities were nearly twice as likely to report past-12-month IPV than women without disabilities (24) .\\nCurrent estimates are likely significant underestimates, as women with disabilities tend to be underrepresented in surveys and may also experience disability-specific types of violence that are often unmeasured. For a better \\nunderstanding of the risk factors for violence against women, and to enable the development of more specialized \\nprevention strategies and response plans, it is necessary to improve the inclusion of women with disabilities and the issue of disability within violence against women in population-based surveys and research. WHO recently issued recommendations for good practice in measuring violence against women with disabilities (25) .\\n4.2.4  Towards disability-\\ninclusive and data-\\ninformed health systems\\nThe way forward to achieve inclusive health systems and \\nleave no one behind includes a systems-level response, through strengthening health systems, that integrates targeted actions to advance health equity for persons with disabilities. It is essential that the actions that \\ngovernments take to advance disability inclusion in the \\nhealth sector are informed by valid and reliable data that allow monitoring and tracking progress.\\nAs shown above, however, data on health inequities \\namong persons with disabilities are scarce. Factors contributing to the inequity are frequently not well captured, making it difficult sometimes to explore the drivers of the differences and whether these differences are indeed due to unjust or unfair factors. The collection of data on disability is often deprioritized in many countries; consequently the evidence of health inequities \\nand their contributing factors is more limited than for \\nother groups in marginalized situations. However, lack of evidence should not be interpreted as a lack of inequities.There is a fundamental need to collect or disaggregate population- and facility-based data based on disability status, across the different levels of country health information systems. For example, at input level, administrative sources such as financial tracking systems, databases and records on human resources, infrastructure or policies can be used to understand how \\nfinancing for disability works, or whether health facilities \\nare accessible. At output level, facility assessments or facility reporting systems can measure availability of services, service readiness or quality. At outcome and impact level, disability-specific surveys or routine health and demographic surveys that allow disaggregation of data by disability, and integrating disability indicators in facility-level data collection can facilitate in-depth understanding of the experiences of persons with \\ndisabilities in terms of health-care needs and coverage. \\nChile is among the countries that have implemented the WHO Model Disability Survey to inform policy (Box 4.5).\\nOnly through valid and reliable data on disability will \\ncountries be able to develop evidenced-based policies to monitor the SDGs, to measure progress towards national targets such as UHC and to take stock of the challenges that remain.\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n76\\nBox 4.5  The role of data in improving the lives of persons with disability in Chile\\nThe Model Disability Survey (MDS), developed by WHO and the World Bank in 2011, addresses the scarcity of \\ndata and often poor quality of information on persons with disabilities in many countries (22) . The survey takes a \\nbroader approach to disability, collecting data on functioning and environmental barriers and facilitators. WHO \\nhas been supporting the successful implementation of the MDS in more than 15 countries to date, providing a comprehensive assessment of the situation of persons with disabilities, and contributing to better public policy.\\nUnder the leadership of the Ministry of Social Development and Family and the National Disability Service \\n(SENADIS), with participation from the Ministry of Health, the WHO MDS was implemented in Chile for the first \\ntime in 2015 (26) . Preparation of the survey took more than a year, including consultation with persons with \\ndisabilities, civil society groups, their families and supporters across all 15 regions of the country.\\nThe survey found that one in six (16.7%) people aged 2  years and older in Chile had disabilities in 2015 (20.0% \\nof adults and 5.8% of children aged 2–17 years). An estimated 59% of adults with disability had a mental or \\nbehavioural disorder. It also identified barriers that persons with disability experienced, including in health and transport (27) .\\nThe findings informed the development of key legislation, plans and actions to address the identified barriers. For example, Law 21.015 on labour inclusion was implemented, setting a labour quota of 1% for workers with disabilities that all companies with more than 100 workers must meet – with plans dedicated to gradually increase this percentage. Furthermore, the results of the study helped design protocols and methodologies to \\nimprove the level of participation of persons with disabilities, such as the 2017 national census that incorporated \\na protocol to interview persons with disabilities in their homes. In addition, the development of the National Mental Health Action Plan, which was launched in 2017, and the National Disability Qualification and Certification Plan. More actions were taken towards improving access to health services among persons with disabilities. In addition, a decision was taken to include disability questions in the country’s National Health Survey to enable the government to better track progress and understand unmet service needs among persons with disabilities.\\nIn line with the WHO recommendation to undertake the MDS every 5–10 years to track progress on the situations \\nof persons with disabilities and dependency, Chile implemented the survey for a second time in 2022 (28) . The \\nresults of the new assessment will help the Government of Chile better understand the impact of disability-related policies and actions that the country has taken, and plan next steps towards addressing the needs of \\npersons with disabilities and to monitor the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons \\nwith Disabilities.\\n4.3 Health of refugees \\nand migrants\\nThe number of international migrants increased from \\n153 million (2.9% of the global population) in 1990 \\nto 281  million (3.6% of the global population) in 2020 \\n(29). This number does not include internal migrants, \\nwhich were estimated to be around 763  million in 2005 \\n(30) . In addition, in mid-2023, an estimated 110  million \\npeople were forcibly displaced, including those who are \\ninternally displaced, refugees and asylum seekers (31).\\nMigration could either improve or degrade an individual’s \\nhealth status. Refugees and migrants often face worse health outcomes in countries of transit and destination due to barriers such as language and cultural differences, institutional discrimination and restricted use of \\nhealth services.\\nThe first WHO World report on the health of refugees and \\nmigrants, released in 2022, offers an overview of the health of refugees and international migrants, along with the associated determinants and public health challenges, while also revealing crucial gaps in global data and knowledge (32). Prioritizing the rights of refugees and migrants to timely, affordable and dignified health care is essential for achieving health equity.\\nKey issues and trends in global health\\n77\\n4.3.1  Key issues affecting \\nthe health of refugees \\nand migrants\\nSome flows of global migration can be predicted by \\nfactors such as economic growth and demographic \\nchanges. However, displacements due to emergencies \\narising from disease outbreaks, conflicts, natural \\ndisasters and climate change pose significant challenges. \\nHealth and social protection systems need to be prepared \\nfor sudden upheaval of populations.\\nNew and renewed emergencies are straining health \\nservices in all WHO regions. In addition to deaths and injuries, the risks of infectious diseases and mental health conditions also increase; meanwhile health facilities may be unable to cope as they are heavily affected by power and supply outages, or even targeted in conflicts. The threat of malnutrition and starvation exists further \\ndown the line as a result of disrupted food supplies, \\nexacerbating critical health needs of already vulnerable populations (33).\\nAlthough a large proportion of refugees and migrants \\nare in generally good health, their numbers also include \\nchildren, elderly people, persons with disabilities, and \\nthose whose health has been negatively impacted by their travels or the circumstances in their home country. \\nSome might start a family, get sick or get injured in their \\nhost country. These health needs transcend national boundaries, but many countries restrict health coverage \\nbased on immigration status, limiting access to health \\ninsurance and services, and the cost of non-emergency \\ncare may be an unaffordable out-of-pocket expense. \\nThese factors leave millions in vulnerable situations \\nglobally, and they may encounter poorer health \\noutcomes, particularly in substandard living and working conditions (33).\\nFor instance, studies have found higher rates of anaemia \\nin women and children among refugees and migrants \\ncompared with local populations, and there is an increased risk of both anaemia and malnutrition in some \\ncamp-based settings (34–39). Migrant workers may face \\ndiscrimination, exploitation, limited workplace rights and social protection, as well as significant occupational health problems, such as higher risk of occupational \\ninjuries documented particularly among male migrant \\nworkers employed in high-risk industries (40–44). During the COVID-19 pandemic, migrant workers in some \\ncountries, particularly those in low-skilled roles, faced \\nheightened exposure risks due to overcrowded living conditions (45–47). Those who were employed in essential sectors such as health care and agriculture bore a \\ndisproportionate burden of pandemic-related challenges \\n(48–51). In addition, refugees and migrants may be \\nparticularly vulnerable to the effects of AMR during \\nvarious phases of migration and displacement, due to \\nfactors such as exposure to infections, limited access to diagnostics and therapeutics and inappropriate use of antibiotics (52).\\nFigure 4.9  Distribution of access to government health services for refugees and migrants across 84 \\ncountries, 2018–2021\\n50\\n37\\n8\\n5\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\nAccess to all services\\nregardless of\\nmigration status\\nAccess to all services\\ndependent on\\nmigration status\\nAccess to\\nemergency health-\\ncare services only\\nNo access to any\\nhealth services\\nProportion of countries (%)\\nSource : WHO (32), based on unpublished data from the International Organization for Migration.\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n78\\nYet, data on health-care access policies from 84 \\ncountries between 2018 and 2021 show that only half \\nof them provide refugees and migrants with access to \\nall government-funded health services under the same \\nconditions as nationals, regardless of migratory status \\n(see Fig. 4.9) (32).\\nAvailable evidence reveals mixed patterns of NCD burden \\nand risks among migrants and refugees compared with \\nhost populations. Taking cancer as an example, studies \\nfrom three high-income countries in the Americas \\nsuggested better outcomes for migrants with cancer, \\nwhereas research from two high-income European \\ncountries indicated that cancer was often diagnosed at advanced stages among refugee and migrant \\npopulations, leading to poorer health outcomes than host \\npopulations (53–56). Studies from three African countries \\nunderscored gaps in cervical cancer awareness among refugee and migrant women, stressing the importance \\nof prevention and early detection interventions (57–59). \\nThese challenges are mirrored in other regions, with \\nrefugee and migrant women facing barriers to HPV \\nvaccination in settings where factors such as clinic accessibility and physician recommendations play \\nsignificant roles (60, 61). Box 4.6 presents an analysis on \\nmigration-related health inequalities based on data from \\n35 European countries.\\nBox 4.6  Migration-related health inequalities in European countries\\nBased on data from 35 European countries collected between 2018 and 2022, migrants (based on country of \\nbirth) tend to be more at risk of poverty, social exclusion and material deprivation – factors that increase risks of ill health (Fig. 4.10). Overall, 18% of non-migrants were at risk of poverty or social exclusion, compared with 29% of migrants. Migrants were also 1.7 times as likely to have material and social deprivation (defined as not being able to afford certain goods, services and social activities), twice as likely to be overburdened by housing costs \\nas a portion of their income and 2.6 times as likely to be living in overcrowded conditions. They were also less \\nlikely (0.8 times) to have social support. However, there was little difference overall between migrants and non-migrants in terms of unmet needs for medical examination, though this varied across countries (18, 21) .\\nFigure 4.10    Inequality in he alth determinants between migrant and non-migrant populations in 35 \\nEuropean countries, 2018–2022\\nIndicator\\nDiﬀerence\\nRatio\\nSubgroup\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\n35\\n40\\n45\\n50\\n55\\n60\\n65\\n70\\n75\\nEstimate (%)\\nPeople at risk of poverty or social exclusion (%)\\n10.7\\n1.6\\nNon-migrant\\nMigrant\\nChildren at risk of poverty (%)\\n10.2\\n1.8\\nNon-migrant\\nMigrant\\nSelf-reported unmet needs for medical examination \\nbecause too expensive, too far to travel or \\nwaiting list (%)\\n0.5\\n1.3\\nNon-migrant\\nMigrant\\nMaterial and social deprivation rate (%)\\n6.2\\n1.7\\nNon-migrant\\nMigrant\\nHousing cost overburden rate (%)\\n7.0\\n2.0\\nNon-migrant\\nMigrant\\nOvercrowding rate (%)\\n13.1\\n2.6\\nNon-migrant\\nMigrant\\nOverall perceived strong social support (%)\\n-7.1\\n0.8\\nNon-migrant\\nMigrant\\nNotes: circles indicate countries – each country is represented by multiple circles (one for each indicator and each subgroup).

Reported high blood pressure prevalence \\nis more than 10  percentage points higher among \\nmigrant populations in three countries, but is more \\nthan 10  percentage points higher among non-migrant \\npopulations in seven other countries (18, 21).Similarly, inequalities in the prevalence of NCD risk factors \\nvaried across countries. For example, the prevalence of \\ntobacco smoking was over 5  percentage points higher \\namong migrants in four countries, but over 5  percentage \\npoints higher among non-migrants in six countries. In eight countries, reported overweight prevalence was at least \\n5 percentage points higher among migrant populations, \\nwhile it was also at least 5  percentage points higher among \\nnon-migrant populations in eight countries (18, 21).\\nTherefore, inequalities in NCDs between migrants and \\nnon-migrants vary significantly across European countries, \\nunderscoring the imperative for tailored, country-specific investigations into health inequalities and their drivers, to inform equity-oriented policies and programmes.\\nWorld health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals\\n80\\n4.3.2  The need for quality \\ndata on refugee and \\nmigrant health\\nThere is a lack of timely, representative and \\nsystematically collected disaggregated data on refugee and migrant health in national health information systems. This makes it challenging to understand and address their health needs, develop inclusive public \\nhealth approaches and track progress towards national \\nand global health goals. Data-driven approaches are vital for fostering health equity and social inclusion. Box 4.7 shows how mixed-methods data generation provides insights into the health status and needs of refugees from Ukraine in Poland.Recognizing the urgency, the WHO Global Action Plan on promoting the health of refugees and migrants emphasizes the collection of high-quality, disaggregated data to monitor progress towards implementation of the six priority areas (62). Since the Global Action Plan is founded on health issues for refugees and migrants, such data and the resulting monitoring will also contribute to \\nthe health-related SDGs for the population on the move, \\nin particular refugees and migrants worldwide. SDG target 17.18 specifically commits to enhancing capacity-building support for countries to significantly increase the availability of high-quality data disaggregated by migratory status.\\nBox 4.7  Mixed-methods data-generation approach provides insights into health status \\nand needs of refugees from Ukraine in Poland\\nThe outbreak of war in Ukraine in 2022 led to an immediate and unprecedented influx of millions of refugees \\nfleeing from Ukraine to other countries in Europe and beyond, with Poland hosting up to 3.5 million refugees at \\nthe height of the crisis. In response to the urgent need for evidence on the health status and needs of refugees, Statistics Poland collaborated closely with WHO at country, regional and headquarters levels. A mixed-methods approach was adopted in the border provinces of Poland, through a representative household survey and behavioural insights research, initiated in 2022, and repeated in 2023. \\nWith the country’s population surging by over 4%, the Polish authorities prioritized understanding the health \\nneeds of the refugees. The results are illustrated in Fig. 4.12 (63) . Even though services were rapidly made \\navailable for them, the European Union directive that allowed such provision does not necessarily address barriers to access, and hence barriers such as language and cultural differences and lack of information hindered and continue to hinder health-care access. Mental health illness, though prevalent, was often underreported due to stigma and practical obstacles.\\nKey issues and trends in global health\\n81\\nFigure 4.12  Health care needsa among Ukrainian refugees in Poland, 2022 and 2023\\n0.4\\n1.2\\n1.2\\n5.2\\n18.2\\n38.7\\n43.9\\n0.6\\n0.7\\n2.0\\n5.0\\n7.0\\n20.2\\n26.2\\n58.4\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\n0.9\\n0.3\\nEndocrinological problemsc\\nAlergological problemsc\\nNeurological problemsc\\n0.9\\n0.8\\nOphthalmological problemsc\\n1.5\\n1.3\\nSexual health\\nOrthopedic problemsc\\nOther\\n4.5\\n6.3\\nMental health\\nPhysical traumatic conditions\\n2.8\\n14.5\\nInfectious diseases, COVID-19b\\nDental services\\nChronic illness\\nAcute illness\\n2023\\n2022\\nPercentage of respondents (%)\\na  R efers to persons who needed health care in the 30  days prior to the interview.

By  both global life expectancy and HALE had rolled back to levels  . years and . years respectively . The following year saw further declines with both retreating to levels . years and . years respectively . The WHO regions most affected were the Region of the Americas and South-East Asia Region with declines of about years in life expectancy and . years in HALE between and . The Western Pacific Region saw the smallest impacts over the first two pandemic years  with losses of less than . and . years in life expectancy and HALE respectively. Globally the share of deaths from noncommunicable diseases NCDs among all deaths rose steadily to .% by  while the share of communicable diseases dropped to .%. With the emergence of COVID-  communicable diseases surged back to .% of all deaths in and .% in – a return to levels. Consequently the share of NCD deaths declined to .% in and .% in . COVID- ranked among the top three leading causes of death globally in and  responsible for . million and . million lives lost respectively. In the Region of the Americas it was the number one cause of death in both years and ranked in the top five causes for all regions except for the African and Western Pacific regions. At the midway point for the SDGs progress on  health-related Goals has been mixed. Among the  health-related indicators included in this report  have numeric SDG or global targets. None of these have yet been achieved and none are on track under current trends. However most indicators  are showing movement in the right direction globally. The world is also off-track to achieve the universal health coverage UHC  health emergencies preparedness and healthier populations “Triple Billion” targets by . From the baselines  million more people are expected to have access to essential health services without incurring catastrophic health spending by  well short of the one billion UHC target. For health emergency preparedness  million more people are expected to be protected by  again short of the target. Healthier populations is the sole area positioned to meet its one billion target with . billion additional people anticipated to be living healthier lives by . But acceleration across all three areas is needed to achieve broader health-related SDGs by . The world continues to grapple with the double burden of malnutrition characterized by the coexistence of undernutrition and overweight obesity. In  worldwide over one billion people aged  years and over were living with obesity while over half a billion were underweight. In the same year  million children under five were affected by stunting  million suffered from wasting and  million were living with overweight. Double-duty actions that efficiently and effectively address both facets of malnutrition are critical to make the most of limited resources. This report also highlights health challenges faced by persons with disabilities and refugees and migrants. Globally in  an estimated . billion people % of the population had disability and faced health inequities due to avoidable unfair and unjust factors. Progress requires strengthening health systems that integrate targeted actions to increase equity. Refugees and migrants are not inherently less healthy than host populations yet various suboptimal health determinants – further exacerbated by linguistic cultural  legal and other barriers – mean that they often experience significant health disparities. Access to health care is often limited for refugees and migrants with only half of the countries surveyed between and  providing them access to government-funded health services on par with nationals. Lack of quality data further obstructs understanding of their needs and tracking progress on health goals. The report serves as a crucial reminder that today’s health systems must swiftly adapt to respond to changing demographics and persisting inequities.   Life expectancy  healthy life expectancy and burden of disease in the light of the COVID- pandemic The COVID- pandemic has wreaked havoc in population health across the globe. The devastating impacts of the pandemic on health economy families and society have been observed worldwide since and are expected to continue to unfold in the years to come. This chapter documents its detrimental impact on global population health and the inequality of that impact as reflected in life expectancy and HALE against the backdrop of the overall progress made in many aspects of population health before the pandemic..

Regional trends Prior to the pandemic life expectancy and HALE had risen across all WHO regions and World Bank country income groups between and  Figs . and . . The greatest gains were seen in low-resources settings including the African Region .-year gain in life expectancy and .-year gain in HALE and the South-East Asia Region .-year gain in life expectancy and .- y ear gain in HALE  and in low-income countries .- y ear gain in life expectancy and .-year gain in HALE . Populations in high-income and upper-middle-income countries continue to live longer and healthier lives than those in low- and lower-middle-income countries. However the pace of improvement in high-income countries has stagnated since  with only a .-year increase in life expectancy and a .-year increase in HALE in – less than one third of the increases in low-income countries over the same period  .

In addition the impact of the pandemic was unequal across regions and income groups. The Region of the Americas and the South-East Asia Region have been the hardest hit life expectancy in both regions dropped by . years and HALE by . years between and . The Western Pacific Region was the least affected during the first two years of the pandemic with less than . years and . years of loss seen for life expectancy and HALE respectively. It was the only WHO region in which increases in life expectancy .-year gain and HALE  .-year gain were observed in . However the region experienced some losses . years in life expectancy and . years in HALE in compared with  that cancelled out the earlier gains  . The scale of pandemic-related tolls also varied over time across regions. The Region of the Americas the European Region and the Eastern Mediterranean Region all experienced more severe impact in the first pandemic year with seeing at least two thirds of the life expectancy decline and three fifths of the HALE decline. In contrast coinciding with the wider spread of the Delta variant the decline in life expectancy and HALE in the African and South-East Asia regions occurred more predominantly in  accounting for at least % of the total losses in – Fig. .  . By World Bank income groups life expectancy was cut by . years in low-income countries and by . years in lower-middle-income countries and HALE cut by . y ears and . years respectively between and . Over half of the years lost in life expectancy and HALE in upper- middle-income countries and over % of those in high-income countries in – occurred during the first year of the pandemic. In lower-middle-income countries the hardest hit occurred in  seeing over % of the loss in life expectancy and HALE. In low-income countries  the worsening of longevity was rather minimal in  associated with only % . of . years of the decline in life expectancy Fig. .  . World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals . Shifting disease burden .. Broad categories of causes of deaths Not only has the pandemic set back healthy longevity worldwide by years it also reversed the previous trends of shifting disease burden to NCDs. Grouping deaths into three broad categories of causes of death – communicable maternal perinatal and nutritional conditions “communicable diseases” hereafter  NCDs  and injuries – clear transition can be noticed well before the pandemic  .Globally NCDs accounted for .% of all deaths in  rising to .% in  while the share of communicable diseases dropped from .% in to .% in  and injuries remained relatively stable around %. As COVID- emerged as a new infectious disease and started to take a toll on human lives the share of deaths due to communicable diseases jumped back to the level .% in and further back to the level .% in . Simultaneously the share of NCD deaths dropped to .% in and to .% in  and the share of injury deaths dropped to just about % in both years Fig. .  . Figure . Composition of causes of death global –      Percentage % Injuries Communicable maternal perinatal and nutritional conditions Noncommunicable diseases Note In countries that have low-quality vital registration WHO’s current estimates include a cause of death category “other pandemic-related mortality OPRM ”  which could include underlying causes of deaths from any of the three groups. The graph only shows the relative composition of the three groups OPRM is not included.  Source WHO  . Life expectancy healthy life expectancy and burden of diseaseAmong WHO regions the African Region still had the largest share .% of deaths attributable to communicable diseases before the pandemic with NCDs accounting for only about % of all deaths in . These levels remained largely stable in and  indicating little impact of the COVID- pandemic on the broad distribution of causes of death. Similarly the Western Pacific Region has seen limited change since in the distribution across the three categories with NCDs accounting for about % and communicable diseases for about % of all deaths Fig. .  . However the pandemic has been more disruptive to the expected trajectories in other WHO regions. The European Region which had the highest share of NCD deaths among all deaths in  .%  experienced an abrupt shift of disease burden back to communicable diseases in and  as the share of NCD deaths dropped to .% in and the share of communicable diseases nearly quadrupled from .% in to .% in . Other WHO regions also experienced sizable reversed shift of disease burden from NCDs and injuries back to communicable diseases leading to increases in its share ranging from about % Eastern Mediterranean Region  to % South-East Asia Region  . Similar disparity was also observed across World Bank income groups Fig. . . Bearing the largest share nearly % of deaths due to communicable diseases low-income countries saw minimal change in the distribution of deaths from the three broad groups between and . In contrast NCDs in upper-middle-income and high-income countries were responsible for the largest share of deaths at .% and .% respectively in  but these figures dropped by .% and .% between  and  .

These patterns are the result of a combination of transitioning cause-of-death profiles and changing population structure. Examining age-standardized death rates ASDR exhibits more clearly the progress achieved prior to the COVID- pandemic and the setback it caused. Globally the ASDR from communicable diseases was cut by about half from . UI .–. to .  UI .–. per  population in –. Yet  the pandemic brought back the rate to . UI .– . per  in and . UI .–. per  in  representing .% and .% increases from the baseline. While the global improvement up to was primarily driven by the progress in the African Region .% decline  South-East Asia Region .% decline and Eastern Mediterranean Region .% decline  the Region of the Americas and the European Region were hardest hit by the pandemic in relative terms with ASDR from communicable diseases more than tripled . and . times respectively between and . The South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions also saw ASDR from communicable diseases more than doubled in the same period. In comparison the African and Western Pacific regions only experienced moderate increases .% and .% increase respectively  . Progress was also made in all WHO regions in – for mortality from NCDs except for the South-East Asia Region and mortality from injuries except for the Eastern Mediterranean Region  leading to .% reduction in ASDR from NCDs and .% reduction in ASDR from injuries globally in –. Limited impact was seen in ASDR from these two groups of cause of death in – compared with that from communicable diseases  . Similar trends were observed across all World Bank income groups with sizable reductions observed in ASDR for all three broad cause categories in – and little excess change brought by the pandemic in and for NCDs and injuries. The COVID- pandemic reversed the declining trend in ASDR for communicable diseases in all income groups to the extent that the level in that was above the level in upper-income countries and nearly double the level in high-income countries thus undoing over two decades of work  . Life expectancy healthy life expectancy and burden of disease.. Leading causes of death Looking at the leading causes of death there was also a clear transition from communicable causes to NCDs. Globally five of the leading causes in were communicable and four were NCDs with road injury being the only injury cause Fig. . . In  seven of the  leading causes were NCDs and the remaining three communicable  . The pace of transition was uneven across regions and income groups. In  communicable diseases continued to take up seven of the top causes of deaths along with two NCDs and one injury in the African Region and low-income countries  . With communicable diseases being effectively prevented or treated and populations surviving to older ages where NCDs become the predominant risk NCDs already accounted for nine of the top causes in in the European Region and the Western Pacific Region  Fig. .  as well as in upper-middle-income and high- income countries Fig. . .

Mortality-related SDG indicators The SDG framework includes several indicators on mortality pertaining to specific age groups such as young children and mortality due to specific causes  . Overall progress has been observed for mortality-related SDG indicators however the current trends are not strong enough to reach the targets by ... Maternal and child mortality Since the turn of the millennium enhancing the health of mothers and children has been a top priority for global development. Maternal and child mortality reductionsThis distribution of the leading causes of death by broad cause group at global level remained unchanged from in and  however COVID- emerged as the third and second leading causes respectively  claiming . million and . million lives globally. In all but two WHO regions the African and Western Pacific regions  COVID- ranked among the top five causes of deaths in and  responsible for the largest number of deaths in both years in the Region of the Americas in in the South-East Asia Region and the second largest number of deaths in both years in the European and the Eastern Mediterranean regions. In the African Region the disease only moved up from th to sixth in . While in the Western Pacific Region it remained out of the top  it rose from being th in to th in  .

An estimated   % UI  –  women globally died from a maternal cause in  a number that remained unacceptably high and is equivalent to almost deaths every day or one every two minutes  . The African Region remained the region with the highest MMR throughout the two decades despite a sustained decline with an ARR of %. The South-East Asia Region had experienced the steepest decline reducing MMR from  % UI – deaths per  live births in to  % UI – deaths per  live births in and still maintaining an ARR at nearly % in the SDG era. Increasing MMRs were seen in the Region of the Americas the European Region and Western Pacific Region between and  despite the sizable decline during the MDG era. However the levels of MMR have remained below deaths per  live births in these three regions since  . To achieve the SDG global target of MMR below  deaths per  live births by  an ARR of .% is required between and  equivalent to over  million deaths averted compared with a scenario where the – global stagnation continues   .

Progress in reducing UMR and NMR slowed in the first half of the SDG era – compared with what was achieved in the MDG era – . Globally the average ARR in UMR decreased from .% UI .–.%  in – to .% % UI .–.% in –. Similarly the ARR for global NMR decreased from .% % UI .–.% in – to .% % UI  .–.% in –  . If current trends continue  countries will not meet the SDG target for UMR  or fewer deaths per live births by . Even more countries are at risk of missing the SDG target for NMR  or fewer deaths per live births by   countries will need to accelerate the mortality decline to meet the target on time. The majority of the countries not on track to achieve the SDG targets are in the African Region reinforcing the fact that children face different chances of survival depending on where they are born. Reaching the targets in all countries and areas will avert  million deaths among children under  years of age between and  some % of which would be among neonates   . .. Mortality due to injury Road injury Despite the growth in the global population and number of vehicles the global number of road traffic fatalities declined by .% from . million UI .–. million  deaths in to . million UI .–. million deaths in   . While countries in four regions achieved the target to halve the number of road traffic deaths during this period at the global level the reduction fell far short of the target of the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety – and at this pace the global target of the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety – to halve deaths by  would not be met either   . In  the South-East Asia and the Western Pacific regions shouldered more than half of the global burden of road traffic deaths with   UI  –  deaths % of the global burden and   UI  –  deaths % of the global burden  respectively   . The decline in the global number of deaths corresponds to a % decline from the crude death rate CDR due to road traffic injuries SDG indicator .. from .  UI .–. deaths per  population in  to .

World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals .. Mortality attributable to environmental risk factors Millions of deaths annually can be attributed to environmental factors such as air pollution and unsafe drinking-water sanitation and hygiene WASH . Mortality attributed to air pollution Exposure to air pollution increases the risk for many negative health outcomes. Five health conditions – stroke ischaemic heart disease lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults and acute lower respiratory infections at all ages – are included in the estimation of SDG indicator .. on mortality attributed to air pollution. Household and ambient air pollution are estimated to have jointly caused . million deaths worldwide in  corresponding to . million attributable to ambient air pollution and . million to household air pollution. The global age-standardized mortality rate attributable to air pollution in was  UI – deaths per   population a slight decline from  UI – deaths per  population in . The African Eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia regions had the highest age-standardized mortality rates attributable to air pollution among WHO regions in  .The causes of the observed differences in air pollution- attributable mortality rates between regions and countries are diverse. First they are due to the different population-weighted ambient and household particulate matter concentrations but the different population distribution by age and underlying mortality patterns by cause also play a role. Mortality attributed to unsafe WASH Unsafe WASH can lead to undesired health outcomes including deaths.

Children under the age of five are particularly vulnerable in  almost four in every five malaria deaths in the region were among these young children  . WHO recently added the programmatic use of malaria vaccines for children living in endemic areas to the malaria prevention toolbox. The first malaria vaccine RTS S AS RTS S  was recommended by WHO in after successful pilot programmes in Ghana Kenya and Malawi through the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme Box . . In  WHO recommended a second safe and effective malaria vaccine R-Matrix-M R  . Wide implementation of malaria vaccines is expected to save tens of thousands of lives each year. Box . Malaria vaccine implementation in Ghana Kenya and Malawi The Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme MVIP was established by WHO to evaluate the public health use of the first malaria vaccine RTS S AS  . Findings from the pilot programme informed the historic WHO recommendation in October for a vaccine to prevent malaria in children. Through the collaborative effort with the ministries of health in Ghana Kenya and Malawi from to  the RTS S malaria vaccine was integrated into routine child immunization services as part of each country’s national malaria control programme. Over million children received the RTS S malaria vaccine through the pilot. Findings from MVIP show that the RTS S vaccine substantially reduces early childhood deaths and hospitalizations for severe malaria. In October  WHO recommended a second safe and effective malaria vaccine R for routine use. This recommendation resulting in sufficient vaccine supply to scale up malaria vaccines broadly coupled with the high impact seen with the introduction of the RTS S vaccine underscores the potential of malaria vaccines as important interventions to act against Plasmodium falciparum  the deadliest malaria parasite globally and the most prevalent in Africa and further supports the case for implementing the malaria vaccine as a routine child immunization. The wide-scale implementation of the malaria vaccines which began in early  holds the potential to save tens of thousands of lives each year. This is not just a scientific breakthrough but a life-saving intervention that can significantly reduce the burden of malaria on our communities. Key findings substantial public health impact  Disease surveillance during months of RTS S vaccine use and scale-up as part of the MVIP showed that malaria vaccine introduction resulted in a % vaccine-attributable reduction in all-cause mortality excluding injury among children age-eligible for vaccination compared with children living in areas where the vaccine was not in use. Substantial reductions in severe malaria and malaria hospitalizations of children were also documented. Measured impact was additional to the benefits from insecticide-treated mosquito net ITN use and access to other child health interventions and care. World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals These findings were measured in the context of vaccine scale-up with an average third-dose coverage of about % and average fourth-dose coverage of about % across the three countries. The substantial public health impact of malaria vaccine is expected to increase as vaccine coverage increases.

Other findings • Malaria vaccine uptake is high with no unintended consequences such as reduction in ITN use uptake of other childhood vaccines or change in health-seeking behaviour. • Quantitative analysis shows that parents understand that malaria vaccine reduces malaria but does not prevent all cases of malaria and continue to use other preventive and care-seeking measures . • Community demand for and health worker acceptance of malaria vaccine is high. • The malaria vaccine has a good safety profile – with more than  million doses provided. • In the three pilot countries malaria vaccine even reached children who were not using other forms of malaria prevention thereby extending the programmatic reach of malaria prevention interventions. The MVIP further established that a moderately efficacious malaria vaccine can have high effectiveness and impact and will be accepted by communities and health workers. Health-related SDGs The MVIP also provided critical information to inform the recently updated WHO recommendation for malaria vaccines that applies to both RTS S and R vaccines and forged a pathway for future malaria vaccine development. Next steps The high demand for malaria vaccines is unprecedented. More than countries have been approved for malaria vaccine introduction support by Gavi the Vaccine Alliance and wider implementation began in . As of April  eight countries in Africa offer the malaria vaccine as part of their childhood immunization programmes Benin Burkina Faso Cameroon Ghana Kenya Liberia Malawi and Sierra Leone and up to additional countries are likely to introduce it this year. Implementing malaria vaccines in Africa represents an important step in the fight against the disease. At least countries in Africa are interested in deploying malaria vaccines as part of their national malaria control plans. Moreover the ministers of health of African countries representing the High Burden High Impact HBHI  countries in Africa met in Yaoundé Cameroon on  March  and declared their unwavering commitment to the accelerated reduction of malaria mortality and pledged to hold each other and countries accountable for the commitments outlined in the Declaration for accelerated malaria mortality reduction in Africa commitment that “No one shall die from malaria”. .. Hepatitis Globally an estimated  million people were living with chronic hepatitis B and C in  of whom  million were living with hepatitis B and  million with hepatitis C.

Egypt becomes the first country to achieve the “gold tier” status on the path to elimination of hepatitis C In  Egypt became the first country to achieve gold tier status on the path to eliminating hepatitis C in accordance with WHO criteria. This means that Egypt has fulfilled WHO’s targets that will set the country up to achieve the reduced incidence and mortality targets of full elimination before . Egypt has implemented one of the world’s largest nationwide public health screening and treatment programmes for hepatitis C. Egypt had one of the highest rates of viral hepatitis in the world. Between the s and s inadvertent infection transmission associated with unsafe injection practices occurred in the attempt to control schistosomiasis a parasitic disease carried by water snails. Since the early s the government has put a huge effort into strengthening hepatitis prevention with programmes covering blood safety infection control and injection safety. It also worked on raising public awareness and running harm reduction programmes. Egypt launched a network of specialized treatment centres in and with the new antiviral medicines discovered in  hepatitis testing and treatment were made accessible and free of charge for everyone. In  the government launched the presidential initiative “ million seha”  million healthy lives  a massive and unprecedented nationwide campaign to detect and treat everyone with hepatitis C escalating its elimination efforts. Through the campaign everyone over was tested later expanding to children years and older. In addition to routine testing at all health facilities the campaign used outreach in the community with teams visiting big squares markets workplaces sports clubs mosques and churches and popular meeting places such as barbershops. Vulnerable communities such as refugees and migrants and persons with disabilities were also included to leave no one behind. Between and  over  million people were tested with WHO-approved rapid diagnostic tests. Patients were also assessed and treated for other chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. A total of . million received treatment for hepatitis C with locally manufactured medicines between and  of which % were virally suppressed. Expanding direct public health approaches to community prevention testing and treatment as shown by Egypt’s successful public health programme to eliminate hepatitis C can have a population-wide impact. A case study concluded that five key elements contributed to Egypt’s successful programme the availability of sufficient and reliable epidemiological data a robust public health care infrastructure inclusive care that reached all sectors of society political commitment with increased health-care spending and a comprehensive long-term strategy for viral hepatitis and use of innovation and information technology  .

Bangladesh eliminates visceral leishmaniasis and lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem In  Bangladesh became the first country globally to be validated for elimination of visceral leishmaniasis  also called kala azar  as a public health problem. The country achieved the elimination target of less than one case per  population at the sub-district  upazila  level in and has sustained it to date despite disruptions related to the COVID- pandemic. In  Bangladesh together with India and Nepal launched a Regional Kala-azar Elimination Initiative with the aim of wiping out the disease. The Government of Bangladesh WHO the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases TDR and several other partners supported research and development of new diagnostic tools effective treatments and vector control especially indoor residual spraying  and facilitated their roll-out and access by all those in need through donation programmes which helped the country meet the criteria set by WHO for elimination as a public health problem  . Kala azar is the most severe form of leishmaniasis and is transmitted by sandflies it is commonly prevalent among the most disadvantaged rural communities. The disease leads to symptoms such as fever weight loss and spleen and liver enlargement and if left untreated can prove fatal in over % of cases. In  Bangladesh was also validated as the fourth country in the WHO South-East Asia Region to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem after Maldives Sri Lanka and Thailand. Lymphatic filariasis also known as elephantiasis occurs when filarial parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquito bites. The infection is usually acquired in childhood with painful and disfiguring visible manifestations appearing much later in life often in the form of enlargement of body parts causing pain severe disability and associated stigma. Lymphatic filariasis was a major public health problem in Bangladesh and was endemic in of its districts. In  the country established a national elimination programme. Between and  high-coverage mass drug administration campaigns were carried out in all endemic districts. A series of transmission assessment surveys was carried out by programme personnel between and  which demonstrated that transmission levels were below the threshold established by WHO for elimination as a public health problem. To meet WHO’s validation criteria on morbidity management and disability prevention   Bangladesh also strengthened access to the recommended essential package of care in all endemic districts. Notably over   people affected by lymphatic filariasis have been trained in self-care and provided with kits to manage their disease condition and improve their quality of life. For both kala azar and lymphatic filariasis Bangladesh will now focus on post-validation surveillance to sustain its hard-won status and prevent recurrence of infection. Source WHO   .

It primarily affects children under years of age but an unvaccinated person at any age can contract the disease. Of the three strains of wild poliovirus type  type and type  wild poliovirus type was eradicated in and wild poliovirus type was eradicated in . As at  endemic wild poliovirus type remains in two countries Afghanistan and Pakistan. In  a total of cases of wild poliovirus were reported in Afghanistan and Pakistan and unlike in previous years no cases were reported from non-endemic countries  . Although immunization coverage including polio began to recover from the impact of the COVID- pandemic during  progress is uneven. There were . million children missing out on any vaccination – the so-called “zero-dose children” – worldwide in . Afghanistan and Pakistan were among the top countries with the highest number of zero-dose children in  highlighting the need for continued intensified efforts to reach all remaining un- or under-immunized children in those endemic areas  . .. Antimicrobial resistance AMR affects countries in all regions and at all income levels. It is a complex problem that requires both sector-specific actions in the human health food production animal and environmental sectors and a coordinated approach across these sectors. In  the World Health Assembly adopted the Global Action Plan on AMR  committing among other things to the development and implementation of multisectoral national action plans  . As of November  some countries had such plans developed. However in only % of countries reported implementing their national action plans effectively and only % had allocated national budgets to do so  .SDG indicator .d. is defined as the percentage of bloodstream infections due to selected antimicrobial-resistant organisms. Median resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in Escherichia coli E. coli and methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus S. aureus were % and % in  respectively compared with .% and .% in . However no conclusions can be made on whether changes in resistance have occurred over time. The reasons for this are twofold first the pool of reporting countries has changed significantly over the years. In  only countries contributed data on resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in E. coli compared with in . Similarly only countries provided data in on methicillin resistance in S. aureus in  compared with in . Second  the number of resource-limited settings providing data has increased in recent years. Testing coverage in these settings is often low with data often limited to tertiary referral private hospitals and or research facilities  and biased towards complex infections and treatment failures. Higher median resistance in recent years is at least in part consistent with potential biases resulting from the convenience sampling of health facilities for reporting AMR data in many settings  . Priorities to address AMR include surveillance of antimicrobial consumption. The Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System GLASS provides a common and standardized set of methods for measuring and reporting. Of the countries with data –   % achieved the target of at least % of total antibiotic consumption being “Access” group antibiotics  . The overall goal is to reduce the use of “Watch and reserve” group antibiotics and to increase the relative benefit and the availability of Access group antibiotics where needed. Health-related SDGs . Risk factors for health Many factors affect the health of individuals and communities. A risk factor for health is any attribute  characteristic or exposure of an individual that increases their likelihood of developing a disease or injury. This section presents progress towards achieving SDG and GPW targets related to several risk factors for health. .. Nutritional risk factors Better nutrition is related to improved infant child and maternal health stronger immune systems lower risk of NCDs and longevity. Today the world faces the multiple burden of malnutrition that comprises undernutrition overweight including obesity and micronutrient deficiencies. Section . discusses the global trends in undernutrition and overweight or obesity. This section summarizes the global progress towards the reduction of anaemia among women and the consumption of trans-fatty acids TFA . Anaemia among women Women with anaemia are more likely to experience fatigue and impaired physical capacity in their daily lives. Moderate and severe anaemia are also risk factors for adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. Global trends in the prevalence of anaemia among all women – years of age SDG indicator .. show no significant change from .% UI .–. in to .% UI .–. in . With population growth  the total number of women aged – years affected increased from  million in to  million in . While there was a slight decrease in anaemia prevalence among pregnant women from .% UI  .–. in to .% UI .–. in  prevalence among non-pregnant women remained stagnant at .% UI .–. in and .% UI  .–. in  . Across WHO regions the decline in anaemia prevalence among women observed during the MDG era either halted or slowed after . This latest evidence suggests that the global target of % reduction of anaemia in women of reproductive age by  from a baseline is unlikely to be met   . Trans-fatty acids Intake of TFA is associated with increased risk of heart attacks and death from coronary heart disease. WHO designated TFA elimination as one of its priority targets in  calling for the global elimination of industrially produced TFA by . Mandatory TFA policies are currently in effect in  countries in all WHO regions covering % of the global population . billion people . Of these countries  have “best-practice” policies which include mandatory national limit of  g of industrially produced TFA per  g of total fat in all foods and mandatory national ban on the production or use of partially hydrogenated oils as an ingredient in all foods. Population coverage by best-practice TFA policies has grown considerably. In  best-practice policies were in effect for just % of the global population  million people . By the end of  this has increased to % coverage . billion people  . However accelerated actions are needed to meet the target of % global population coverage  . .. Behavioural risk factors Modifiable behaviours such as tobacco use alcohol consumption physical inactivity and an unhealthy diet are among the known risk factors associated with NCDs. This section summarizes the global progress towards the reduction of tobacco use and alcohol consumption. Tobacco use The Global action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs – which has been extended until  includes a target for reducing the global prevalence of tobacco use by % by the year  relative to   . In  the global age-standardized prevalence of current tobacco use among persons aged years and older SDG indicator .a. was estimated at .% UI .–.  a % relative decline from .% in . If current trends continue the world will see a % relative reduction in prevalence by .

The proportion of total domestic and industrial wastewater flows that are safely treated is monitored by SDG indicator ... Wastewater statistics however are at an early stage of development in many countries and there is a lack of reporting especially from industrial sources. Among the countries representing % of the global population reporting volumes of total wastewater generated and treated % of total wastewater flows received some level of treatment in .

However water sector ODA disbursements as a percentage of total ODA across all sectors decreased to .% in  a historical low and continuing a downwards trend which has accelerated since the start of the COVID- pandemic in  . These trends show that while progress towards universal access to safe WASH has been made in some areas there are still some gaps in data and service coverage. Sustained actions to promote equitable access to WASH services are necessary to tackle these challenges.

Risks to women’s and girls’ health Women and girls face certain health risks as they are in a disadvantaged position not only due to biological factors but also sociocultural factors in some societies. For example an emphasis on women’s reproductive roles and potential or actual experience of physical sexual and psychological violence may prevent women and girls from fully accessing quality health services and attaining the best possible level of health. Adolescent pregnancy Child marriage and child sexual abuse place girls at increased risk of pregnancy often unintended. In many places barriers to obtaining and using contraceptives prevent adolescents from avoiding unintended pregnancies. In  there were an estimated . million births among teenage girls aged – years and almost half a million births among very young girls aged – years together representing % of all births worldwide.

Violence against women Intimate partner violence IPV – including physical sexual and psychological violence – and sexual violence against women and girls cause serious short- and long-term physical mental sexual and reproductive health problems for women and girls. They also affect the health and well-being of their children and families. Trend analyses based on data up to suggest that there has been insufficient progress in reducing IPV against women and girls over the past two decades  .

Health systems strengthening as a key means to achieve UHC In September  at the United Nations General Assembly high-level meeting on UHC political leaders reaffirmed their commitment to taking action for UHC  . Building on the Political Declaration on UHC   the Political Declaration provides a roadmap to accelerate implementation towards achieving health for everyone everywhere and ensuring that no one is left behind. It acknowledges the importance of health systems strengthening based on a primary health care PHC approach which is critical not just for centring people and communities but also for effective health emergency prevention preparedness response and recovery which has never been more salient than during the COVID- pandemic.UHC grounded in the principle that all individuals and communities should have access to quality essential health services throughout the entire spectrum of care without enduring financial hardships not only contributes to improving health outcomes SDG  but also plays a pivotal role in other SDGs including economic growth and job creation SDG  gender equality SDG  education SDG  nutrition SDG  and poverty reduction SDG . Strengthening health systems and enhancing the sustainability and equity of health services and financing models are pivotal factors that contribute to the successful achievement of UHC. This section delves into SDG indicators related to service delivery and health financing illustrating disparities across WHO regions and World Bank country income groups. Health-related SDGs .. Service delivery Service delivery the primary interface between health systems and people includes a wide range of health service providers but also public health-care institutions and other actors responsible for essential public health functions and provision of health-care products. Scaling up the coverage of essential health services with an emphasis  on PHC Scaling up the coverage of effective essential health services is a fundamental strategy for achieving UHC. It aims not only to improve health outcomes but also to promote health equity and ensure that health care is universally accessible and of high quality. SDG indicator .. referred to as the UHC service coverage index aims to measure the average coverage of essential services through a single index score based on indicators across four domains reproductive maternal newborn and child health RMNCH  infectious diseases NCDs and service capacity and access. This  Achieving the –– targets requires that % of people living with HIV know their HIV status % of people who know their status are receiving ART  and % of people on ART have suppressed viral loads. This translates to % of people living with HIV knowing their HIV status % of people living with HIV receiving ART  and % of people living with HIV having suppressed viral loads.score increased remarkably from to between  and globally but progress has slowed since and even stagnated during the COVID- pandemic. The highest index scores were in the European Region the Region of the Americas and the Western Pacific Region  around  followed by South-East Asia   Eastern Mediterranean  and African regions  .

In contrast global coverage of Human papillomavirus HPV vaccine SDG indicator .b. – HPV  critical for women’s and girls’ health globally only reached % in  with countries having introduced the HPV vaccine in their national immunization services by the end of . The % target set by the Immunization Agenda is unlikely to be met for any of these vaccinations if current trends continue   . Moreover while there has been a positive increase in the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel SDG indicator ..  rising from % in to % in and notably improving outcomes in childbirth it is important to acknowledge a slowdown in the pace of progress since  and the global target of % coverage by is unlikely to be met unless progress is accelerated   . Positive advancements have been observed in service coverage of NCDs which continue to contribute the highest proportion of the disease burden. For example  according to the latest estimates the proportion of adults aged – years receiving treatment for hypertension increased from % in to % in . The effective coverage for hypertension treatment is estimated to have more than doubled from % to % over the same period  . Data on treatment coverage for alcohol and drug use disorders between and range from extremely low .% to a maximum of % for drug use disorders and % for alcohol use disorders in the countries that were able to report these data in . To address challenges in estimating treatment coverage for substance use disorders SDG indicator ..  a service capacity index has been introduced as a complementary measure index range – . This index varied significantly among countries with values ranging from to in . The highest index values were observed in the European Region   while the lowest were in the African Region   .In most settings efficiency and equity in the delivery of health services requires an increased emphasis on frontline services particularly PHC. Increasing the recruitment  development training and retention of the health workforce Health workers are the cornerstone of a resilient health system and the demand for health workers continues to increase as global health challenges become more complex and the world’s population grows and ages. To make progress towards UHC it is critical to address the global shortage of health workers so that adequate numbers of health workers are available in the right quantity in the right places in alignment with population health needs  . Based on the latest data available over the period – for each country low-income countries had the lowest health worker density and distribution SDG indicator .c. with a median of only . medical doctors interquartile range [IQR] .–.  .

An analysis of countries with available data over three consecutive time periods  – – – reveals a consistent increase in the density and distribution of health workers across all income groups except for dentists in low-income and lower-middle-income countries and pharmacists in middle-income countries Fig. .  . However even when national densities seem adequate  disparities persist at subnational level. Improving access to medicines and health technologies To achieve equitable access to medicines and health technologies major attention is required to this subsystem within health systems. Since  the proportion of health facilities that have a core set of relevant essential medicines available and affordable on a sustainable basis SDG indicator .b. has been estimated for only countries in the WHO Africa Region  Region of the Americas and European Region with a median value of % across the countries IQR –%   . Work is ongoing to improve the methodology to measure access to essential medicines and other health- care products to enable sustained global monitoring. The COVID- pandemic highlighted the huge and growing divide between high- and low-income countries in accessing medicines and health-care products and the need for innovation and local production to enhance the equitable distribution of health-care products i.e. medicines vaccines diagnostics and devices  .

Implementing the International Health Regulations IHR and service delivery models that promote resilience The ability to prevent detect and respond to health emergencies is a critical component of UHC. Service delivery models that are truly fit for purpose need to be equipped to implement the IHR and to develop a clear sense of the types of threats they may face and to prepare for them. The IHR States Parties Self-Assessment Annual Report  SPAR tool consists of indicators for the IHR capacities needed to detect assess notify report and respond to public health risks and acute events of domestic and international concern SDG indicator .d. .

Towards stronger health security in the Pacific island countries Understanding the national capacities in health security in a regional and international context is especially important in regions that face distinctive health security challenges such as the South Pacific. The South Pacific spans one third of the Earth’s surface yet it is inhabited by less than % of the global population. The remoteness of the region often functions as a gatekeeper for infectious diseases but makes it more likely for outbreaks of waterborne and foodborne diseases. The South Pacific is prone to extreme weather events such as cyclones and flooding which are increasing in intensity and frequency. Additionally the South Pacific’s rising sea levels exceed the global mean rate reaching about mm per year  further increasing the region’s vulnerability  . Until  a limited number of Pacific island countries submitted a SPAR regularly making it difficult to identify address and strengthen health security in the region. In August  thirteen Pacific island countries committed to bolstering health security reporting mechanisms during a meeting of Pacific IHR national focal points. One of the Pacific island countries with a complex set of challenges is Kiribati which comprises atolls scattered across the equator and over  million square kilometres of water. In addition to infectious diseases  natural disasters such as the drought and the cyclone Pam have severely impacted Kiribati’s health security. The drought affected water and food access for  of the  people in Kiribati while cyclone Pam caused widespread flooding and damage including in the capital Tarawa   . In preparation for Kiribati’s Ministry of Health to submit IHR SPAR a multisectoral consultation was organized in collaboration with WHO in December . The involvement of representatives from different sectors such as emergency response agriculture financing and legislation helped to ensure that the SPAR scores accurately reflected the country’s situation. By February  Kiribati – together with other Pacific island countries Cook Islands Fiji Marshall Islands  the Federated States of Micronesia Nauru Niue Palau Samoa Solomon Islands Tonga Vanuatu – submitted their SPARs. This has been the highest number of SPAR submissions in the region so far shedding light on areas for improvement. Areas with the biggest gaps in the South Pacific scoring on average less than out of points per area are policy legal and normative instruments to implement IHR infection prevention and control IPC  points of entry PoEs and border health health services provision zoonotic diseases food safety chemical events and radiation emergencies. Countries also declared gaps in financing human resources IHR coordination national IHR Focal Point functions and advocacy. Kiribati SPAR results in identified areas where more attention would be needed in cross-sectoral approaches including for zoonotic diseases radiation emergencies and chemical events Fig. . . The review process for completing the SPAR helped to map out where there were capacity gaps and opportunities for strengthening in coming years. Recognizing the importance of IHR Kiribati integrates the SPAR score average as one of the indicators in its National Health Strategic Plan – with the assessment as the baseline Fig. . . There is a commitment in the National Health Strategic Plan to improve on the SPAR score in the coming four years with annual monitoring.

Health financing Health financing arrangements determine the ability of health systems to respond to health needs pool financial risks and operate efficiently and equitably. They span choices and decisions in three interlinked financing functions – mobilizing resources pooling them and using them to strategically purchase health services. Mobilizing resources and prioritizing health The Addis Ababa Action Agenda AAAA recognized that the primary mechanism for meeting resource needs for achieving the SDGs should be domestic  . In  global government health spending the health component of SDG indicator .a. surged except in low-income countries Fig. . . High- and upper-middle-income nations increased health priority due to COVID--related expenditures. In lower-middle-income countries slower growth in health spending compared with general government spending resulted in reduced health priority in almost half of them though outliers boosted the average. Among low-income countries half saw declining health priority as reduced government health spending coincided with higher general spending. External aid likely played a significant role in financing health-care expenses related to the COVID- pandemic in low- and lower-middle-income nations echoing a trend where higher external funding in low-income countries correlated with lower health priority in government budgets during the MDG period  .Development assistance for health DAH  to complement domestic financing As part of the AAAA countries committed to reverse the decline in aid to the poorest and fragile countries  many of which will require sustained DAH to address capacity constraints and continue progress toward UHC. However DAH must add to domestic resources rather than crowding them out and support efforts to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of domestic resources utilization. In  the African Region received the highest weighted average health ODA per capita US$ . compared with countries in other regions less than US$  per capita  SDG indicator .b.  . While DAH has undeniably contributed to noteworthy health improvements the current architecture and incentives associated with such assistance have inadvertently led many nations to neglect funding for basic health services in their own budgets and become overly aid-dependent  . The COVID- pandemic has shown the perils of overdependence on external sources of finance and distant suppliers for critical health needs  . Improve financial protection for all Expanding pooling arrangements is essential to provide protection from the economic consequences of ill health and enhance equity in service use – to reduce foregone care for financial reasons financial hardship due to out- of-pocket OOP health payments and indebtedness due to health cost.

Even prior to the COVID- pandemic and despite long- standing high-level commitments to health for all and UHC progress was largely off-track. Many governments have neglected foundational investments in health systems. Consequently health services have been disrupted and inequities between and within countries have worsened during the COVID- pandemic. Achieving UHC requires targeted resource allocation and a renewed commitment to building resilient health systems that prioritize access to essential services for the poor and most vulnerable.

Among the health-related SDG indicators reviewed in this report  have numeric SDG or other global targets. None of these targets has been achieved thus far and none is likely to be met if current trends continue. However most of the indicators  out of  are showing progress in the right direction globally the remaining indicators are either moving in the wrong direction or cannot be assessed due to limited data. New and refocused commitment and capacities at national regional and global levels are key to accelerate progress and reverse worrying trends. Health-related SDGs References .

World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals   Progress towards WHO Triple Billion targets The WHO Triple Billion targets outlined in and as the foundation of the WHO GPW are a set of ambitious goals aimed at improving global health by  one billion more people benefitting from UHC one billion more people better protected from health emergencies and one billion more people enjoying better health and well-being   . Functioning as both an impact measurement tool and a policy strategy they are an integral part of the GPW Results Framework. The targets focus on achieving measurable impacts on people’s health at the country regional and global levels. They are tangible related to human lives and able to drive changes.Triple Billion targets are based on outcome indicators to track the progress that WHO and its Member States achieve in improving population health at the country level. The indicators include SDG indicators and seven non-SDG indicators approved by WHO Member States to address country priorities during the nd World Health Assembly WHA  in   . The close alignment between the Triple Billion and SDGs enables countries to apply Triple Billion targets in delivering their commitments on the SDGs. Triple Billion projections were calculated for the years – relative to a baseline providing much- needed milestones for progress made at the global  regional and country levels in providing promoting and protecting global health. This chapter focuses on the global and regional results to date  . Overall the world has collectively achieved the healthier population billion target but is lagging on the other two billions. Relative to  there was an estimated . billion UI .–. billion more people enjoying better health and well-being in  this will likely rise to more than . billion UI .–. billion by . In contrast there was only . billion UI .–. billion  more people in benefitting from UHC and only . billion .–. billion better protected from health emergencies. These figures will likely rise to . billion  .–. billion and . billion UI .–. billion by  respectively – far below the target of one billion  . The overall contribution of the UHC billion was disaggregated and the contribution of each underlying tracer indicator calculated allowing for precise assessment of the impact of these individual indicators  . . Healthier populations billion The healthier populations HPOP billion aims to improve population health and well-being by promoting healthier behaviours lifestyles and environments. Achieving this billion relies on multisectoral intervention through advocacy and changes in public policy and regulation. The calculation of this billion comprised tracer indicators including four disaggregated indicators that cover a wide range of health topics including clean air safe water road safety tobacco and alcohol consumption obesity violence child nutrition and development.Overall the world has been progressing steadily towards the HPOP billion target since . This target was achieved in with . billion UI .–. billion more people enjoying better health and well-being compared with . Although this trend was not reversed progress slowed considerably during the – COVID- pandemic. The year-to-year change of HPOP contribution was  million from to  but was only  million from to  followed by  million in and  million in . Relative to  the Figure .

UHC billion The UHC billion is for improvement in the number of people having access to essential health services but without inflicting financial hardship. The calculation of progress towards the UHC billion relied on the assessment of two components   average service coverage measured through tracer indicators and   financial hardship measured through an indicator of catastrophic health spending defined as the proportion of population whose household expenditure on health is greater than % of total household expenditure or income. By  there were only  million more people benefitting from UHC without incurring catastrophic health spending compared with  not even reaching half of the UHC billion target. The projection for  is a mere  million suggesting that the world is seriously off the mark in achieving the UHC billion target. The impact of COVID- pandemic was salient as the UHC billion reduced or stalled in and before reversing the negative trend in . The situation called for accelerated efforts and dramatic changes in public policies to expand UHC  . Among the six WHO regions the Region of the Americas was the only region where the number of people benefitting from UHC decreased in and compared with  Fig. . . The European Region also experienced setbacks in the two pandemic years as shown by the near-zero UHC billion estimates  .

Health emergencies protection billion The health emergencies protection HEP billion aims to have one billion more people better protected from health emergencies. The index for this billion was calculated based on SDG by measuring three indices  i emergency preparation  ii emergency prevention and  iii emergency detection and responses. At the global level there has been consistent improvement in the HEP billion since  Fig. . . However such progress is still not sufficient to achieve the HEP billion target by . Progress towards the HEP billion even stalled or regressed in and  in multiple WHO regions. The Region of the Americas saw a downward trend starting from that extended through . The improvement in the HEP billion was relatively small in the Western Pacific European and Eastern Mediterranean regions compared with other regions.

Health-related SDGs and health information system The Triple Billion targets leverage the global and national commitments to meet the health-related SDGs. Given the centrality of the health-related SDGs in the Triple Billion target construct the Triple Billion target projections allow WHO and its Member States to assess their progress towards the targets for SDG indicators. The projected Triple Billion progress since  the first year of the GPW showed that significant progress has been achieved for all three of the billions particularly the HPOP billion as the world has likely already achieved the target of having one billion more people living healthier lives by  Fig. . . However such progress is far from sufficient to ensure the health-related SDG targets are achieved globally. Figure . illustrates the gap between Triple Billion projections based on current trends and an alternative scenario where hypothetical annualized rate of changes at the country level are applied such that each SDG indicator target is met by  .

However the figure would be . billion by and . billion by if the world meets all global indicator targets.

Source WHO  . The world needs to intensify efforts to achieve the health- related SDG targets by  which is vital for building healthier more equitable and prosperous societies globally. For such efforts timely and accurate monitoring of the progress based on robust data is vital for effective policy changes and interventions. However lack of timely reporting and delay in producing health estimates using the most recent empirical data could bring great challenges in delivering accurate assessment for many health outcomes. Figure . shows the percentage of UHC service coverage index tracers for which primary data were available for years –. It is evident that most indicators suffered from a data shortage at various degrees across countries. A lot could be done to enhance the data input for the Triple Billion computation. More often than not the lack of data will not be limited to the data required by the Triple Billion rather it is deeply entrenched in poorly performing health information systems. Thus efforts should be made to strengthen the general health information systems in countries to generate reliable data for the effective tracking of and policy changes regarding health-related SDGs. WHO is committed to work with Member States to strengthen their system capacity to collect analyse and use health data. Various tools have been developed by WHO to enhance countries’ data capacity. For example  the WHO SCORE for health data technical package was designed to assess the performance of national health information systems identify the data gaps and provide a toolbox to improve various areas of a functioning health information system  . The Data management competency framework DMCF developed by the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific is another example of such a tool it enables health information managers to identify capacity gaps and drive competency development at various levels Box . .

Strategic and integrated capacity-building of the health information workforce in the Western Pacific Region Strategic use of data for decision-making is critical for measuring and driving progress towards global and national health indicator targets. Capacity limitations of health information workers HIW often hinder the ability to effectively produce and use health data despite significant improvements in health information systems. HIWs often do not possess the required capacities to participate consistently and in a timely manner in the data management cycle. To systematically assess such capacity gaps the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific with support from WHO headquarters country offices and in collaboration with partner organizations launched the DMCF in May   . This framework is a comprehensive integrated and coherent tool that can be used to define and assess current and future competency needs of HIWs across the region and beyond. This tool will enable health information managers in countries to identify capacity gaps and plan and drive the competency development of their HIWs across different levels of their health system. Papua New Guinea has set out a clear path as the first country to adopt the framework. As a direct outcome of a national health information workshop held in October  Papua New Guinea National Department of Health collaborated with WHO to establish a standardized set of competencies required for health information positions at both national and provincial levels based on the ideally required skills and competencies spelled out in the WHO DMCF. These competency profiles are invaluable as they provide a clear foundation for developing tools to assess training needs and formulating comprehensive long-term capacity-building strategies. The national data management competency profiles were officially launched together with the Provincial Health Authority Monitoring & Evaluation toolkit in September . China followed suit by identifying the framework’s value in improving health information workforce capacity in a systematic and sustainable manner. The Center for Health Statistics and Information of the National Health Commission of China collaborated with WHO in translating the framework into Chinese and conducted a series of workshops at both national and provincial levels in preparation for conducting competency gap assessments among different types of health workers across different provinces. The adoption of the framework in Papua New Guinea and China serves as pivotal examples highlighting how the WHO DMCF could be applied to each Member State’s unique context. This ability to contextualize and apply the framework is essential given the diverse nature of Member States’ health information systems and their diverse priorities and needs in addressing both present and future health challenges. Progress towards WHO Triple Billion targets . Conclusion The WHO Triple Billion is a framework and a strategy aiming to drive timely improvement of global health. The targets although set at the global level were simply the aggregation of country-level estimates that were calculated based on underlying tracer indicators. The Triple Billion projections provide WHO its Member States and partners with the much-needed assessment of progress towards fulfilling their commitment on Triple Billion targets and the health-related SDGs. Tracer indicators are the cornerstone of the Triple Billion targets but also a critical tool for countries to identify and prioritize strategies to enhance the health of their populations. By examining the projected contributions at indicator level policy-makers can make informed course adjustments to achieve the SDGs set by the global community.As the GPW is drawing to a close in  continuous tracking of the Triple Billion targets and a proper transition from GPW to GPW is vital for WHO to ensure accountability adaptability and efficiency in achieving the ambitious goals it set jointly with its Member States. All three levels of WHO – headquarters regional and country offices – should make every effort to align their priorities. Through these priorities that will be reflected in the new programmatic and outcome indicators for the upcoming GPW WHO will reaffirm its commitment to address evolving global health needs enhance collaboration with stakeholders and strengthen its role in advancing global health equity and security. Committed investment in improving data and health information systems across the globe will be essential for such endeavours. References .

World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals   Key issues and trends in global health The global population and economic growth the advancement of science and technology and the ever- increasing interconnectedness of the world have brought about enormous societal changes along with unprecedented progress but also multiple and complex challenges affecting the health of billions of people worldwide. This chapter looks at selected key global health issues such as the double burden of malnutrition where undernutrition coexists in parallel with overweight and obesity globally. It also highlights the health challenges faced by persons with disabilities and refugees and international migrants.. The double burden of malnutrition Combating malnutrition in all its forms is one of the greatest global health challenges. Today the world faces the double burden of malnutrition characterized by the coexistence of undernutrition along with overweight and obesity within individuals households and populations  and across the life course. This section highlights the global and regional trends in the population-level burden of stunting wasting and overweight among children under  years of age and the double burden of thinness or underweight and obesity among older children adolescents and adults. Box . summarizes the definitions of the indicators of malnutrition used in this section. Child stunting stems from poor nutrition during pregnancy and early childhood. It can lead to severe physical and cognitive damage that may last a lifetime. A child who is moderately or severely wasted due to recent rapid weight loss or a failure to gain weight has an increased risk of death. In contrast a child may be overweight due to excessive caloric intake which may be due to poor access to nutritious foods consumption of nutrient-poor ultra-processed foods and or inadequate physical activity. In childhood and adolescence obesity is associated with greater risks and earlier onset of various NCDs such as type diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In addition children and teenagers living with obesity may experience psychosocial consequences from stigma discrimination and bullying. Undernutrition as measured by thinness among children aged – years lowers learning potential weakens the immune system and increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Micronutrient deficiencies and anaemia in adolescent girls amplify the risk of life-threatening complications during pregnancy and childbirth. In adults obesity is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality from a variety of NCDs such as cardiovascular diseases diabetes cancers neurological disorders chronic respiratory diseases and digestive disorders. Undernutrition in adults as captured by the underweight indicator is critical for adult women during pregnancy with repercussions for both mother and child. In older adults undernutrition can lead to increased risk of impaired immune response and physical and cognitive impairment. In turn ageing brings physiological changes with sensory impairment poor oral health isolation loneliness and depression which further exacerbate the risk of undernutrition. Box .

World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals .. The magnitude of the problem In  an estimated  million UI – million  children under  years of age globally were affected by stunting too short for age and  million UI – million were affected by wasting too thin for height  revealing the vast extent of undernutrition among the youngest population. However an estimated  million  UI – million children under  years of age were overweight in  . In the same year among older children and adolescents aged – years an estimated  million UI – million were living with thinness while  million  UI – million were living with obesity. Among adults aged years and older an estimated  million were underweight while  million were living with obesity. This means that over one billion people aged  years and older worldwide are living with obesity while over half a billion others are living with underweight or thinness  . These numbers along with the health implications described above indicate that the world is dealing with a public health problem not only at a massive scale but also a complex one... Stunting wasting and overweight among children under  years of age Undernutrition among children under  years of age globally as reflected by the number affected by stunting and wasting has declined in the past three decades. The number affected by stunting declined from  million UI – million in to  million  UI – million in . Over the same period the number affected by wasting declined from  million  UI – million to  million UI – million  and the number of overweight rose from  million UI  – million to  million UI – million  .

Key issues and trends in global health At this pace of change the world is off-track to meet the global targets to halve the number of children under  years of age affected by stunting from the  baseline and to reduce the prevalence of wasting and overweight to less than %   . Almost all WHO regions are experiencing a considerable burden of both undernutrition in the form of stunting and wasting and overweight among the youngest population. In the South-East Asia Region the prevalence of overweight nearly doubled in the past three decades  reaching .% UI .–.% in  while the prevalence of wasting continued to be the highest across all WHO regions despite having declined from .% UI .–.% in to .% UI .–.% in . This means that in almost one in five .% children in this region were either too thin or too heavy for their height. In addition three out of  .% UI .–.% children were affected by stunting even though its prevalence had halved since when it stood at .% UI .–.%  Fig. .  . In the Eastern Mediterranean Region approximately the same proportion of children were affected by wasting .% UI .–.% and overweight .% UI .–.% in  while a quarter .% UI .–.% of all children under  years of age were affected by stunting. The Region of the Americas had the highest prevalence of overweight .% UI .–.% across all WHO regions in  and very low prevalence of wasting .% UI .–.% . However about one in  .% UI .–.% children in this region were affected by stunting that year  Fig. . . Peru is notable both regionally and globally for a massive reduction in stunting prevalence Box .  . Box . A dramatic reduction in childhood stunting in Peru Since  few countries have reduced the prevalence of stunting among children under years of age as dramatically as Peru. It is estimated to have declined from a very high prevalence of .% UI .–.% in  to .% UI .–.% in  which is considered a medium prevalence. The ARR .% per year substantially surpasses that in the Region of the Americas .% per year as well as in the upper-middle-income countries .% per year  Fig. .   . An analysis of drivers of the decline in stunting prevalence in Peru from to identified multiple determinants of stunting reduction including socioeconomic class parental education parental health and differences in maternal and newborn health care. Reducing the equity gap contributed greatly to this reduction  with the greatest reductions observed in the lowest wealth quintile in rural areas and among children with the least-educated mothers. The slope index of inequality a measure of absolute wealth-related inequality indicates that the gap in stunting prevalence among children under years of age between the richest and poorest households reduced by half between and  leading to greater equity. Peru’s experience offers useful lessons in tackling the problem of stunting with the participation of multiple sectors  . Figure .

The Western Pacific Region also experienced a large increase in the double burden as the obesity prevalence increased almost tenfold to reach .% UI .–.% in  largely overtaking the dominance of thinness. The South-East Asia Region was the only region where the double burden decreased as thinness prevalence fell sharply from .% UI .–.% to .% UI .–.%  however the region continued to have the highest thinness prevalence while obesity prevalence increased at an alarming rate from .% UI .–.% in to .% UI .–.% in  Fig. .  .

Between and  the number of adults aged years and older living with obesity increased dramatically by almost  million  reaching  million UI – million  while the number living with underweight decreased by  million to  million UI – million  . Globally the combined age-standardized prevalence of underweight and obesity among adults aged  years and older increased from .% in to .% in . This increase has been driven by the rise in obesity the age-standardized prevalence of which more than doubled from .% UI .–.% in to .% UI .–.% in . The age-standardized prevalence of underweight halved in the same period from .% UI  .–.% in to .% UI .–.% in . This means that obesity has taken over the dominance in the double burden of malnutrition among adults globally in the past three decades Fig. .  .Obesity prevalence among adults aged years and older increased in all WHO regions. The Region of the Americas and the Eastern Mediterranean Region have experienced the largest absolute increase in obesity prevalence since  leading to the highest obesity prevalence across WHO regions in  affecting one third of adults in the Region of the Americas and almost three in in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. In the European Region the . percentage point increase in the double burden was due entirely to the rise in obesity prevalence as thinness prevalence remained low. About half of the double burden in the African Region was due to obesity in  up from about one fifth in . The Western Pacific Region remained the region with the lowest combined prevalence of underweight and obesity among adults but obesity is becoming dominant. Underweight prevalence decreased markedly in the South-East Asia Region from .% UI .–.% in to .% UI .–.% in  driving the only decrease of the double burden among adults across all WHO regions. However underweight remained highly prevalent among adults while obesity prevalence increased eightfold since to reach .% UI .–.% in  Fig. .  .

Double-duty actions to tackle the double burden of malnutrition The coexistence of undernutrition overweight and obesity can be addressed by taking advantage of the shared drivers across forms of malnutrition including biological environmental and social factors to design and implement policies and programmes using a life- course multi-generational approach. These double- duty actions are evidence-based efficient and effective interventions that can make the most of often limited time fiscal and human resources. Common delivery platforms that can be leveraged for double-duty actions include national dietary guidelines health systems urban food systems humanitarian settings and social policies – . Double-duty actions need not necessarily be new actions. Rather policy-makers can capitalize on existing government buy-in and resources by reviewing and refocusing existing food and agriculture policies. They often already exist to address single forms of malnutrition but need to be refocused to address multiple forms simultaneously. Strong opportunities for double-duty actions include the following examples school feeding programmes that focus only on addressing undernutrition or overweight can be redesigned to ensure that they instead provide and promote a healthy diet scaling up the WHO antenatal care recommendations protecting and promoting breastfeeding revising complementary feeding guidelines and educating care-givers on the risks of unhealthy complementary foods designing social support and welfare programmes to reduce risks from unhealthy foods and ensuring that food systems and food environment policies facilitate the purchase and consumption of a healthy diet by increasing access to and attractiveness of nutritious foods. Nutrition and food safety are closely interlinked and essential for achieving positive health outcomes from food systems. There is a linkage between subclinical infection with enteropathogens and stunting   . Food must be safe available accessible nutritious  culturally acceptable and ingested regularly to ensure growth health and well-being. Unsafe food increases infection and intoxication creating a vicious cycle of disease malnutrition and disability particularly affecting vulnerable groups. . Disability-related health inequities Disability results from the interaction between health conditions and or impairments that a person experiences such as dementia blindness or spinal cord injury and a range of contextual factors related to different environmental and personal factors including societal attitudes access to infrastructure discriminatory policies  poverty age and gender. This understanding of disability is grounded in the WHO International classification of functioning disability and health ICF  published in  . According to the WHO Global report on health equity for persons with disabilities  approximately . billion persons in – about % of the global population – had disability. The global number of persons with disabilities has increased substantially in the past decade due to demographic and epidemiological changes such as population growth and the increase in the number of persons with NCDs who are living longer and ageing with limitations in functioning  . Persons with disabilities often experience health inequities due to avoidable unjust and unfair conditions. They die younger have poorer health and increased disease risk and more limitations in their everyday functioning. The contributing factors to these inequities can be i health-system-related factors such as barriers in physical infrastructure and communication negative attitudes by health workers or lack of disability data in the health information system  ii structural factors such as stigma and discrimination  iii social determinants such as poverty and lack of education and iv disease risk factors such as tobacco consumption and obesity. World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals .. Premature mortality among persons with disabilities Data on health inequities in terms of premature mortality among persons with disabilities are scarce. However a growing body of evidence indicates that persons with disabilities have higher rates of premature mortality compared with persons without disabilities  . A systematic review of studies from low- and middle- income countries found that persons with disabilities have double the mortality rates of persons without disabilities  . Premature mortality is even more visible in those that are most marginalized among persons with disabilities. For example evidence from some high-income European countries shows that persons with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities have higher risks of premature mortality compared with the general population – . The COVID- pandemic exacerbated this pattern. A systematic review of studies found that persons with disabilities were almost three times as likely to die from COVID- than persons without disabilities  ... Poorer health and higher disease risk among persons with disabilities Persons with disabilities have in general poorer health and higher risk of developing secondary health conditions  . Data from across European countries collected via the European Health Interview Survey in show that overall compared with persons without disability persons with severe disability are more likely to report having NCDs including chronic respiratory diseases over eight times as likely  coronary heart disease or angina pectoris  times as likely  stroke  times as likely  diabetes almost six times as likely  and depression over eight times as likely . The gap in the self-reported morbidity between persons with and without disability varies greatly across the European countries but morbidity remains consistently higher among persons with disabilities Fig. .  .

Key issues and trends in global health .. Contributing factors to health inequities among persons with disabilities There is a range of contributing factors within and beyond the health system that drive premature mortality and increased morbidity among persons with disabilities. In terms of health-system factors lack of accessible and inclusive health service provision often leaves persons with disabilities behind. A systematic review of  studies from eight high-income countries found that women with disabilities are % less likely to have been screened for breast cancer and % less likely to have been screened for cervical cancer than their non-disabled peers  . Data from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in countries show that children with disabilities are generally at greater risk of missing out on vaccinations  only % of children aged – months with more  than one functional difficulty are fully vaccinated compared with % of children at the same age without disabilities  . Evidence from countries shows that persons with disabilities have lower access to health services than those without disabilities Fig. . . Across these countries the median estimate shows that persons with disabilities are more than four times as likely as persons without disabilities to be unable to get health care when they need it % of persons with disabilities versus % of persons without disabilities indicated that they needed but could not get health care. In eight countries more than % of persons with disabilities were not able to get health care when they needed it   . In European countries costs of services geographical location and long waiting lists which disproportionately affect persons with disabilities are major factors in the lower access to health services. Beyond health-system factors persons with disabilities are also more likely to have risk factors for ill health. Data from European countries show that compared with persons without disabilities persons with severe disabilities are overall three times as likely to self-report having high blood pressure twice as likely to be obese and a third as likely to do regular aerobic physical activity Fig. .  . Very often the reason for the higher risk factor presence in persons with disabilities is the lack of accessible health promotion and prevention strategies which do not allow this population to benefit equally  . Different social determinants also play an important role as factors that drive health inequities among persons with disabilities. Poverty is a solid example to demonstrate this. Poor living conditions and social exclusion add to the risk of poor health and unmet health-care needs among persons with disabilities. Across European countries .% of persons with severe disabilities were at risk of poverty before social transfers  such as benefits allowances and pensions  compared with .% of persons with no disability. Yet even after social transfers poverty risk is still double among persons with disabilities .% compared with .%  Fig. . . In nine countries there was little or no disability-related inequity in poverty risk ≤  percentage points difference  yet in the remaining countries the gap ranged up to . percentage points   .

World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals Poverty affects the state of health of persons with disabilities – through inability to afford health-related expenses overcrowded and poor living conditions that contribute to the spread of diseases poor mental health and social exclusion among other factors. According to the analysis from European countries persons with severe disability are overall twice as likely to report having unmet health-care needs due to financial limitations than persons with no disability. They are also almost twice as likely to be unable to meet unexpected financial expenses e.g. having surgery or repairing their house  more likely to be overburdened by housing costs and four times as likely to be living in conditions with  SDG indicator ...

Intimate partner violence against women with disabilities A systematic review of studies mainly from high-income countries concluded that the prevalence of all forms of IPV including physical psychological emotional sexual and financial was higher among women with disabilities than among women without disabilities  . Evidence is also emerging from low- and middle-income countries. For example analysis of data from seven violence-prevention programmes in low- and middle-income countries indicated that women with disabilities were nearly twice as likely to report past--month IPV than women without disabilities  . Current estimates are likely significant underestimates as women with disabilities tend to be underrepresented in surveys and may also experience disability-specific types of violence that are often unmeasured. For a better understanding of the risk factors for violence against women and to enable the development of more specialized prevention strategies and response plans it is necessary to improve the inclusion of women with disabilities and the issue of disability within violence against women in population-based surveys and research. WHO recently issued recommendations for good practice in measuring violence against women with disabilities  . .. Towards disability- inclusive and data- informed health systems The way forward to achieve inclusive health systems and leave no one behind includes a systems-level response through strengthening health systems that integrates targeted actions to advance health equity for persons with disabilities. It is essential that the actions that governments take to advance disability inclusion in the health sector are informed by valid and reliable data that allow monitoring and tracking progress. As shown above however data on health inequities among persons with disabilities are scarce. Factors contributing to the inequity are frequently not well captured making it difficult sometimes to explore the drivers of the differences and whether these differences are indeed due to unjust or unfair factors. The collection of data on disability is often deprioritized in many countries consequently the evidence of health inequities and their contributing factors is more limited than for other groups in marginalized situations. However lack of evidence should not be interpreted as a lack of inequities.There is a fundamental need to collect or disaggregate population- and facility-based data based on disability status across the different levels of country health information systems. For example at input level administrative sources such as financial tracking systems databases and records on human resources infrastructure or policies can be used to understand how financing for disability works or whether health facilities are accessible. At output level facility assessments or facility reporting systems can measure availability of services service readiness or quality. At outcome and impact level disability-specific surveys or routine health and demographic surveys that allow disaggregation of data by disability and integrating disability indicators in facility-level data collection can facilitate in-depth understanding of the experiences of persons with disabilities in terms of health-care needs and coverage. Chile is among the countries that have implemented the WHO Model Disability Survey to inform policy Box . . Only through valid and reliable data on disability will countries be able to develop evidenced-based policies to monitor the SDGs to measure progress towards national targets such as UHC and to take stock of the challenges that remain. World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals Box . The role of data in improving the lives of persons with disability in Chile The Model Disability Survey MDS  developed by WHO and the World Bank in  addresses the scarcity of data and often poor quality of information on persons with disabilities in many countries  . The survey takes a broader approach to disability collecting data on functioning and environmental barriers and facilitators. WHO has been supporting the successful implementation of the MDS in more than countries to date providing a comprehensive assessment of the situation of persons with disabilities and contributing to better public policy. Under the leadership of the Ministry of Social Development and Family and the National Disability Service  SENADIS  with participation from the Ministry of Health the WHO MDS was implemented in Chile for the first time in   . Preparation of the survey took more than a year including consultation with persons with disabilities civil society groups their families and supporters across all regions of the country. The survey found that one in six .% people aged  years and older in Chile had disabilities in  .% of adults and .% of children aged – years . An estimated % of adults with disability had a mental or behavioural disorder. It also identified barriers that persons with disability experienced including in health and transport  . The findings informed the development of key legislation plans and actions to address the identified barriers. For example Law . on labour inclusion was implemented setting a labour quota of % for workers with disabilities that all companies with more than workers must meet – with plans dedicated to gradually increase this percentage. Furthermore the results of the study helped design protocols and methodologies to improve the level of participation of persons with disabilities such as the national census that incorporated a protocol to interview persons with disabilities in their homes. In addition the development of the National Mental Health Action Plan which was launched in  and the National Disability Qualification and Certification Plan. More actions were taken towards improving access to health services among persons with disabilities. In addition a decision was taken to include disability questions in the country’s National Health Survey to enable the government to better track progress and understand unmet service needs among persons with disabilities. In line with the WHO recommendation to undertake the MDS every – years to track progress on the situations of persons with disabilities and dependency Chile implemented the survey for a second time in   . The results of the new assessment will help the Government of Chile better understand the impact of disability-related policies and actions that the country has taken and plan next steps towards addressing the needs of persons with disabilities and to monitor the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. . Health of refugees and migrants The number of international migrants increased from  million .% of the global population in  to  million .% of the global population in   . This number does not include internal migrants  which were estimated to be around  million in   . In addition in mid- an estimated  million people were forcibly displaced including those who are internally displaced refugees and asylum seekers  . Migration could either improve or degrade an individual’s health status. Refugees and migrants often face worse health outcomes in countries of transit and destination due to barriers such as language and cultural differences institutional discrimination and restricted use of health services. The first WHO World report on the health of refugees and migrants released in  offers an overview of the health of refugees and international migrants along with the associated determinants and public health challenges while also revealing crucial gaps in global data and knowledge  . Prioritizing the rights of refugees and migrants to timely affordable and dignified health care is essential for achieving health equity. Key issues and trends in global health .. Key issues affecting the health of refugees and migrants Some flows of global migration can be predicted by factors such as economic growth and demographic changes. However displacements due to emergencies arising from disease outbreaks conflicts natural disasters and climate change pose significant challenges. Health and social protection systems need to be prepared for sudden upheaval of populations. New and renewed emergencies are straining health services in all WHO regions. In addition to deaths and injuries the risks of infectious diseases and mental health conditions also increase meanwhile health facilities may be unable to cope as they are heavily affected by power and supply outages or even targeted in conflicts. The threat of malnutrition and starvation exists further down the line as a result of disrupted food supplies  exacerbating critical health needs of already vulnerable populations  . Although a large proportion of refugees and migrants are in generally good health their numbers also include children elderly people persons with disabilities and those whose health has been negatively impacted by their travels or the circumstances in their home country. Some might start a family get sick or get injured in their host country. These health needs transcend national boundaries but many countries restrict health coverage based on immigration status limiting access to health insurance and services and the cost of non-emergency care may be an unaffordable out-of-pocket expense. These factors leave millions in vulnerable situations globally and they may encounter poorer health outcomes particularly in substandard living and working conditions  . For instance studies have found higher rates of anaemia in women and children among refugees and migrants compared with local populations and there is an increased risk of both anaemia and malnutrition in some camp-based settings – . Migrant workers may face discrimination exploitation limited workplace rights and social protection as well as significant occupational health problems such as higher risk of occupational injuries documented particularly among male migrant workers employed in high-risk industries – . During the COVID- pandemic migrant workers in some countries particularly those in low-skilled roles faced heightened exposure risks due to overcrowded living conditions – . Those who were employed in essential sectors such as health care and agriculture bore a disproportionate burden of pandemic-related challenges  – . In addition refugees and migrants may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of AMR during various phases of migration and displacement due to factors such as exposure to infections limited access to diagnostics and therapeutics and inappropriate use of antibiotics  . Figure .

World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals Yet data on health-care access policies from  countries between and show that only half of them provide refugees and migrants with access to all government-funded health services under the same conditions as nationals regardless of migratory status  see Fig. .  . Available evidence reveals mixed patterns of NCD burden and risks among migrants and refugees compared with host populations. Taking cancer as an example studies from three high-income countries in the Americas suggested better outcomes for migrants with cancer  whereas research from two high-income European countries indicated that cancer was often diagnosed at advanced stages among refugee and migrant populations leading to poorer health outcomes than host populations – . Studies from three African countries underscored gaps in cervical cancer awareness among refugee and migrant women stressing the importance of prevention and early detection interventions – . These challenges are mirrored in other regions with refugee and migrant women facing barriers to HPV vaccination in settings where factors such as clinic accessibility and physician recommendations play significant roles   .

Overall % of non-migrants were at risk of poverty or social exclusion compared with % of migrants. Migrants were also . times as likely to have material and social deprivation defined as not being able to afford certain goods services and social activities  twice as likely to be overburdened by housing costs as a portion of their income and . times as likely to be living in overcrowded conditions. They were also less likely . times to have social support. However there was little difference overall between migrants and non-migrants in terms of unmet needs for medical examination though this varied across countries   . Figure .

Source Authors’ analysis of data from the European Health Interview Survey and the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions –    . Patterns of inequality in NCD burden and risk factors between migrants and non-migrants varied greatly across European countries reflecting the multifaceted influence of genetic social environmental and other factors that contribute to NCD burden Fig. . . For example the proportion of people reporting a long-standing illness or health problem is more than  percentage points higher among migrants compared with non-migrants in seven countries but is more than  percentage points higher among non-migrants in six other countries. Reported high blood pressure prevalence is more than  percentage points higher among migrant populations in three countries but is more than  percentage points higher among non-migrant populations in seven other countries   .Similarly inequalities in the prevalence of NCD risk factors varied across countries. For example the prevalence of tobacco smoking was over  percentage points higher among migrants in four countries but over  percentage points higher among non-migrants in six countries. In eight countries reported overweight prevalence was at least  percentage points higher among migrant populations  while it was also at least  percentage points higher among non-migrant populations in eight countries   . Therefore inequalities in NCDs between migrants and non-migrants vary significantly across European countries  underscoring the imperative for tailored country-specific investigations into health inequalities and their drivers to inform equity-oriented policies and programmes. World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals .. The need for quality data on refugee and migrant health There is a lack of timely representative and systematically collected disaggregated data on refugee and migrant health in national health information systems. This makes it challenging to understand and address their health needs develop inclusive public health approaches and track progress towards national and global health goals. Data-driven approaches are vital for fostering health equity and social inclusion. Box . shows how mixed-methods data generation provides insights into the health status and needs of refugees from Ukraine in Poland.Recognizing the urgency the WHO Global Action Plan on promoting the health of refugees and migrants emphasizes the collection of high-quality disaggregated data to monitor progress towards implementation of the six priority areas  . Since the Global Action Plan is founded on health issues for refugees and migrants such data and the resulting monitoring will also contribute to the health-related SDGs for the population on the move  in particular refugees and migrants worldwide. SDG target . specifically commits to enhancing capacity-building support for countries to significantly increase the availability of high-quality data disaggregated by migratory status. Box . Mixed-methods data-generation approach provides insights into health status and needs of refugees from Ukraine in Poland The outbreak of war in Ukraine in led to an immediate and unprecedented influx of millions of refugees fleeing from Ukraine to other countries in Europe and beyond with Poland hosting up to . million refugees at the height of the crisis. In response to the urgent need for evidence on the health status and needs of refugees Statistics Poland collaborated closely with WHO at country regional and headquarters levels. A mixed-methods approach was adopted in the border provinces of Poland through a representative household survey and behavioural insights research initiated in  and repeated in . With the country’s population surging by over % the Polish authorities prioritized understanding the health needs of the refugees. The results are illustrated in Fig. .  . Even though services were rapidly made available for them the European Union directive that allowed such provision does not necessarily address barriers to access and hence barriers such as language and cultural differences and lack of information hindered and continue to hinder health-care access.

            "In just two years the COVID- pandemic reversed over a decade of gains in both life expectancy at birth and healthy life expectancy HALE . By  both global life expectancy and HALE had rolled back to levels  . years and . years respectively . The following year saw further declines with both retreating to levels . years and . years respectively . The WHO regions most affected were the Region of the Americas and South-East Asia Region with declines of about years in life expectancy and . years in HALE between and . The Western Pacific Region saw the smallest impacts over the first two pandemic years  with losses of less than . and . years in life expectancy and HALE respectively. Globally the share of deaths from noncommunicable diseases NCDs among all deaths rose steadily to .% by  while the share of communicable diseases dropped to .%. With the emergence of COVID-  communicable diseases surged back to .% of all deaths in and .% in – a return to levels. Consequently the share of NCD deaths declined to .% in and .% in . COVID- ranked among the top three leading causes of death globally in and  responsible for . million and . million lives lost respectively. In the Region of the Americas it was the number one cause of death in both years and ranked in the top five causes for all regions except for the African and Western Pacific regions. At the midway point for the SDGs progress on  health-related Goals has been mixed. Among the  health-related indicators included in this report  have numeric SDG or global targets. None of these have yet been achieved and none are on track under current trends. However most indicators  are showing movement in the right direction globally. The world is also off-track to achieve the universal health coverage UHC  health emergencies preparedness and healthier populations “Triple Billion” targets by . From the baselines  million more people are expected to have access to essential health services without incurring catastrophic health spending by  well short of the one billion UHC target. For health emergency preparedness  million more people are expected to be protected by  again short of the target. Healthier populations is the sole area positioned to meet its one billion target with . billion additional people anticipated to be living healthier lives by . But acceleration across all three areas is needed to achieve broader health-related SDGs by . The world continues to grapple with the double burden of malnutrition characterized by the coexistence of undernutrition and overweight obesity. In  worldwide over one billion people aged  years and over were living with obesity while over half a billion were underweight. In the same year  million children under five were affected by stunting  million suffered from wasting and  million were living with overweight. Double-duty actions that efficiently and effectively address both facets of malnutrition are critical to make the most of limited resources. This report also highlights health challenges faced by persons with disabilities and refugees and migrants. Globally in  an estimated . billion people % of the population had disability and faced health inequities due to avoidable unfair and unjust factors. Progress requires strengthening health systems that integrate targeted actions to increase equity. Refugees and migrants are not inherently less healthy than host populations yet various suboptimal health determinants – further exacerbated by linguistic cultural  legal and other barriers – mean that they often experience significant health disparities. Access to health care is often limited for refugees and migrants with only half of the countries surveyed between and  providing them access to government-funded health services on par with nationals. Lack of quality data further obstructs understanding of their needs and tracking progress on health goals. The report serves as a crucial reminder that today’s health systems must swiftly adapt to respond to changing demographics and persisting inequities.   Life expectancy  healthy life expectancy and burden of disease in the light of the COVID- pandemic The COVID- pandemic has wreaked havoc in population health across the globe. The devastating impacts of the pandemic on health economy families and society have been observed worldwide since and are expected to continue to unfold in the years to come. This chapter documents its detrimental impact on global population health and the inequality of that impact as reflected in life expectancy and HALE against the backdrop of the overall progress made in many aspects of population health before the pandemic..

Regional trends Prior to the pandemic life expectancy and HALE had risen across all WHO regions and World Bank country income groups between and  Figs . and . .

Populations in high-income and upper-middle-income countries continue to live longer and healthier lives than those in low- and lower-middle-income countries. However the pace of improvement in high-income countries has stagnated since  with only a .-year increase in life expectancy and a .-year increase in HALE in – less than one third of the increases in low-income countries over the same period  .

In addition the impact of the pandemic was unequal across regions and income groups. The Region of the Americas and the South-East Asia Region have been the hardest hit life expectancy in both regions dropped by . years and HALE by . years between and . The Western Pacific Region was the least affected during the first two years of the pandemic with less than . years and . years of loss seen for life expectancy and HALE respectively. It was the only WHO region in which increases in life expectancy .-year gain and HALE  .-year gain were observed in . However the region experienced some losses . years in life expectancy and . years in HALE in compared with  that cancelled out the earlier gains  . The scale of pandemic-related tolls also varied over time across regions. The Region of the Americas the European Region and the Eastern Mediterranean Region all experienced more severe impact in the first pandemic year with seeing at least two thirds of the life expectancy decline and three fifths of the HALE decline. In contrast coinciding with the wider spread of the Delta variant the decline in life expectancy and HALE in the African and South-East Asia regions occurred more predominantly in  accounting for at least % of the total losses in – Fig. .  . By World Bank income groups life expectancy was cut by . years in low-income countries and by . years in lower-middle-income countries and HALE cut by . y ears and . years respectively between and .

In low-income countries  the worsening of longevity was rather minimal in  associated with only % . of . years of the decline in life expectancy Fig. .  . World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals . Shifting disease burden .. Broad categories of causes of deaths Not only has the pandemic set back healthy longevity worldwide by years it also reversed the previous trends of shifting disease burden to NCDs. Grouping deaths into three broad categories of causes of death – communicable maternal perinatal and nutritional conditions “communicable diseases” hereafter  NCDs  and injuries – clear transition can be noticed well before the pandemic  .Globally NCDs accounted for .% of all deaths in  rising to .% in  while the share of communicable diseases dropped from .% in to .% in  and injuries remained relatively stable around %. As COVID- emerged as a new infectious disease and started to take a toll on human lives the share of deaths due to communicable diseases jumped back to the level .% in and further back to the level .% in . Simultaneously the share of NCD deaths dropped to .% in and to .% in  and the share of injury deaths dropped to just about % in both years Fig. .  . Figure . Composition of causes of death global –      Percentage % Injuries Communicable maternal perinatal and nutritional conditions Noncommunicable diseases Note In countries that have low-quality vital registration WHO’s current estimates include a cause of death category “other pandemic-related mortality OPRM ”  which could include underlying causes of deaths from any of the three groups. The graph only shows the relative composition of the three groups OPRM is not included.  Source WHO  . Life expectancy healthy life expectancy and burden of diseaseAmong WHO regions the African Region still had the largest share .% of deaths attributable to communicable diseases before the pandemic with NCDs accounting for only about % of all deaths in . These levels remained largely stable in and  indicating little impact of the COVID- pandemic on the broad distribution of causes of death. Similarly the Western Pacific Region has seen limited change since in the distribution across the three categories with NCDs accounting for about % and communicable diseases for about % of all deaths Fig. .  . However the pandemic has been more disruptive to the expected trajectories in other WHO regions. The European Region which had the highest share of NCD deaths among all deaths in  .%  experienced an abrupt shift of disease burden back to communicable diseases in and  as the share of NCD deaths dropped to .% in and the share of communicable diseases nearly quadrupled from .% in to .% in . Other WHO regions also experienced sizable reversed shift of disease burden from NCDs and injuries back to communicable diseases leading to increases in its share ranging from about % Eastern Mediterranean Region  to % South-East Asia Region  . Similar disparity was also observed across World Bank income groups Fig. . . Bearing the largest share nearly % of deaths due to communicable diseases low-income countries saw minimal change in the distribution of deaths from the three broad groups between and . In contrast NCDs in upper-middle-income and high-income countries were responsible for the largest share of deaths at .% and .% respectively in  but these figures dropped by .% and .% between  and  .

These patterns are the result of a combination of transitioning cause-of-death profiles and changing population structure. Examining age-standardized death rates ASDR exhibits more clearly the progress achieved prior to the COVID- pandemic and the setback it caused. Globally the ASDR from communicable diseases was cut by about half from . UI .–. to .  UI .–. per  population in –. Yet  the pandemic brought back the rate to . UI .– . per  in and . UI .–. per  in  representing .% and .% increases from the baseline. While the global improvement up to was primarily driven by the progress in the African Region .% decline  South-East Asia Region .% decline and Eastern Mediterranean Region .% decline  the Region of the Americas and the European Region were hardest hit by the pandemic in relative terms with ASDR from communicable diseases more than tripled . and . times respectively between and . The South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions also saw ASDR from communicable diseases more than doubled in the same period. In comparison the African and Western Pacific regions only experienced moderate increases .% and .% increase respectively  . Progress was also made in all WHO regions in – for mortality from NCDs except for the South-East Asia Region and mortality from injuries except for the Eastern Mediterranean Region  leading to .% reduction in ASDR from NCDs and .% reduction in ASDR from injuries globally in –. Limited impact was seen in ASDR from these two groups of cause of death in – compared with that from communicable diseases  . Similar trends were observed across all World Bank income groups with sizable reductions observed in ASDR for all three broad cause categories in – and little excess change brought by the pandemic in and for NCDs and injuries. The COVID- pandemic reversed the declining trend in ASDR for communicable diseases in all income groups to the extent that the level in that was above the level in upper-income countries and nearly double the level in high-income countries thus undoing over two decades of work  . Life expectancy healthy life expectancy and burden of disease.. Leading causes of death Looking at the leading causes of death there was also a clear transition from communicable causes to NCDs. Globally five of the leading causes in were communicable and four were NCDs with road injury being the only injury cause Fig. . .

Mortality-related SDG indicators The SDG framework includes several indicators on mortality pertaining to specific age groups such as young children and mortality due to specific causes  . Overall progress has been observed for mortality-related SDG indicators however the current trends are not strong enough to reach the targets by ... Maternal and child mortality Since the turn of the millennium enhancing the health of mothers and children has been a top priority for global development. Maternal and child mortality reductionsThis distribution of the leading causes of death by broad cause group at global level remained unchanged from in and  however COVID- emerged as the third and second leading causes respectively  claiming . million and . million lives globally. In all but two WHO regions the African and Western Pacific regions  COVID- ranked among the top five causes of deaths in and  responsible for the largest number of deaths in both years in the Region of the Americas in in the South-East Asia Region and the second largest number of deaths in both years in the European and the Eastern Mediterranean regions. In the African Region the disease only moved up from th to sixth in . While in the Western Pacific Region it remained out of the top  it rose from being th in to th in  .

The African Region remained the region with the highest MMR throughout the two decades despite a sustained decline with an ARR of %. The South-East Asia Region had experienced the steepest decline reducing MMR from  % UI – deaths per  live births in to  % UI – deaths per  live births in and still maintaining an ARR at nearly % in the SDG era. Increasing MMRs were seen in the Region of the Americas the European Region and Western Pacific Region between and  despite the sizable decline during the MDG era.

Even more countries are at risk of missing the SDG target for NMR  or fewer deaths per live births by   countries will need to accelerate the mortality decline to meet the target on time. The majority of the countries not on track to achieve the SDG targets are in the African Region reinforcing the fact that children face different chances of survival depending on where they are born.

About countries with good vital registration data that are available for and or present a mixed picture of NCD premature mortality during the pandemic. Some countries saw further slowdown of reduction or even increasing NCD mortality during the pandemic as a result of disruptions to NCD services while other countries observed accelerated decline in NCD premature mortality. The latter may well be an artefact as patients with  Trajectories of NCD mortality after the onset of the COVID- pandemic are still being understood. In countries that have low-quality vital registration WHO’s current estimates include a cause of death category “other pandemic-related mortality”  that likely includes NCD mortality. Future work will explore how NCD mortality changed in these countries in –  .NCDs are also at greater danger of dying prematurely from COVID- as a competing risk and so recorded as COVID- deaths . There are still many unknowns around the progress in NCD premature mortality during the COVID- pandemic that can only be answered with more and better cause of death data to document the trends during and after the pandemic.

Mortality attributable to environmental risk factors Millions of deaths annually can be attributed to environmental factors such as air pollution and unsafe drinking-water sanitation and hygiene WASH . Mortality attributed to air pollution Exposure to air pollution increases the risk for many negative health outcomes. Five health conditions – stroke ischaemic heart disease lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults and acute lower respiratory infections at all ages – are included in the estimation of SDG indicator .. on mortality attributed to air pollution. Household and ambient air pollution are estimated to have jointly caused . million deaths worldwide in  corresponding to . million attributable to ambient air pollution and . million to household air pollution. The global age-standardized mortality rate attributable to air pollution in was  UI – deaths per   population a slight decline from  UI – deaths per  population in . The African Eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia regions had the highest age-standardized mortality rates attributable to air pollution among WHO regions in  .The causes of the observed differences in air pollution- attributable mortality rates between regions and countries are diverse. First they are due to the different population-weighted ambient and household particulate matter concentrations but the different population distribution by age and underlying mortality patterns by cause also play a role. Mortality attributed to unsafe WASH Unsafe WASH can lead to undesired health outcomes including deaths.

In  the region accounted for % of global malaria cases and % of global malaria deaths. Children under the age of five are particularly vulnerable in  almost four in every five malaria deaths in the region were among these young children  . WHO recently added the programmatic use of malaria vaccines for children living in endemic areas to the malaria prevention toolbox. The first malaria vaccine RTS S AS RTS S  was recommended by WHO in after successful pilot programmes in Ghana Kenya and Malawi through the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme Box . . In  WHO recommended a second safe and effective malaria vaccine R-Matrix-M R  . Wide implementation of malaria vaccines is expected to save tens of thousands of lives each year. Box . Malaria vaccine implementation in Ghana Kenya and Malawi The Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme MVIP was established by WHO to evaluate the public health use of the first malaria vaccine RTS S AS  . Findings from the pilot programme informed the historic WHO recommendation in October for a vaccine to prevent malaria in children. Through the collaborative effort with the ministries of health in Ghana Kenya and Malawi from to  the RTS S malaria vaccine was integrated into routine child immunization services as part of each country’s national malaria control programme. Over million children received the RTS S malaria vaccine through the pilot. Findings from MVIP show that the RTS S vaccine substantially reduces early childhood deaths and hospitalizations for severe malaria. In October  WHO recommended a second safe and effective malaria vaccine R for routine use. This recommendation resulting in sufficient vaccine supply to scale up malaria vaccines broadly coupled with the high impact seen with the introduction of the RTS S vaccine underscores the potential of malaria vaccines as important interventions to act against Plasmodium falciparum  the deadliest malaria parasite globally and the most prevalent in Africa and further supports the case for implementing the malaria vaccine as a routine child immunization. The wide-scale implementation of the malaria vaccines which began in early  holds the potential to save tens of thousands of lives each year. This is not just a scientific breakthrough but a life-saving intervention that can significantly reduce the burden of malaria on our communities. Key findings substantial public health impact  Disease surveillance during months of RTS S vaccine use and scale-up as part of the MVIP showed that malaria vaccine introduction resulted in a % vaccine-attributable reduction in all-cause mortality excluding injury among children age-eligible for vaccination compared with children living in areas where the vaccine was not in use. Substantial reductions in severe malaria and malaria hospitalizations of children were also documented. Measured impact was additional to the benefits from insecticide-treated mosquito net ITN use and access to other child health interventions and care. World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals These findings were measured in the context of vaccine scale-up with an average third-dose coverage of about % and average fourth-dose coverage of about % across the three countries. The substantial public health impact of malaria vaccine is expected to increase as vaccine coverage increases.

Other findings • Malaria vaccine uptake is high with no unintended consequences such as reduction in ITN use uptake of other childhood vaccines or change in health-seeking behaviour. • Quantitative analysis shows that parents understand that malaria vaccine reduces malaria but does not prevent all cases of malaria and continue to use other preventive and care-seeking measures . • Community demand for and health worker acceptance of malaria vaccine is high. • The malaria vaccine has a good safety profile – with more than  million doses provided. • In the three pilot countries malaria vaccine even reached children who were not using other forms of malaria prevention thereby extending the programmatic reach of malaria prevention interventions. The MVIP further established that a moderately efficacious malaria vaccine can have high effectiveness and impact and will be accepted by communities and health workers. Health-related SDGs The MVIP also provided critical information to inform the recently updated WHO recommendation for malaria vaccines that applies to both RTS S and R vaccines and forged a pathway for future malaria vaccine development. Next steps The high demand for malaria vaccines is unprecedented. More than countries have been approved for malaria vaccine introduction support by Gavi the Vaccine Alliance and wider implementation began in . As of April  eight countries in Africa offer the malaria vaccine as part of their childhood immunization programmes Benin Burkina Faso Cameroon Ghana Kenya Liberia Malawi and Sierra Leone and up to additional countries are likely to introduce it this year. Implementing malaria vaccines in Africa represents an important step in the fight against the disease. At least countries in Africa are interested in deploying malaria vaccines as part of their national malaria control plans. Moreover the ministers of health of African countries representing the High Burden High Impact HBHI  countries in Africa met in Yaoundé Cameroon on  March  and declared their unwavering commitment to the accelerated reduction of malaria mortality and pledged to hold each other and countries accountable for the commitments outlined in the Declaration for accelerated malaria mortality reduction in Africa commitment that “No one shall die from malaria”. ..

Egypt becomes the first country to achieve the “gold tier” status on the path to elimination of hepatitis C In  Egypt became the first country to achieve gold tier status on the path to eliminating hepatitis C in accordance with WHO criteria. This means that Egypt has fulfilled WHO’s targets that will set the country up to achieve the reduced incidence and mortality targets of full elimination before . Egypt has implemented one of the world’s largest nationwide public health screening and treatment programmes for hepatitis C. Egypt had one of the highest rates of viral hepatitis in the world. Between the s and s inadvertent infection transmission associated with unsafe injection practices occurred in the attempt to control schistosomiasis a parasitic disease carried by water snails. Since the early s the government has put a huge effort into strengthening hepatitis prevention with programmes covering blood safety infection control and injection safety. It also worked on raising public awareness and running harm reduction programmes. Egypt launched a network of specialized treatment centres in and with the new antiviral medicines discovered in  hepatitis testing and treatment were made accessible and free of charge for everyone. In  the government launched the presidential initiative “ million seha”  million healthy lives  a massive and unprecedented nationwide campaign to detect and treat everyone with hepatitis C escalating its elimination efforts. Through the campaign everyone over was tested later expanding to children years and older. In addition to routine testing at all health facilities the campaign used outreach in the community with teams visiting big squares markets workplaces sports clubs mosques and churches and popular meeting places such as barbershops. Vulnerable communities such as refugees and migrants and persons with disabilities were also included to leave no one behind. Between and  over  million people were tested with WHO-approved rapid diagnostic tests. Patients were also assessed and treated for other chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. A total of . million received treatment for hepatitis C with locally manufactured medicines between and  of which % were virally suppressed. Expanding direct public health approaches to community prevention testing and treatment as shown by Egypt’s successful public health programme to eliminate hepatitis C can have a population-wide impact. A case study concluded that five key elements contributed to Egypt’s successful programme the availability of sufficient and reliable epidemiological data a robust public health care infrastructure inclusive care that reached all sectors of society political commitment with increased health-care spending and a comprehensive long-term strategy for viral hepatitis and use of innovation and information technology  .

Bangladesh eliminates visceral leishmaniasis and lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem In  Bangladesh became the first country globally to be validated for elimination of visceral leishmaniasis  also called kala azar  as a public health problem. The country achieved the elimination target of less than one case per  population at the sub-district  upazila  level in and has sustained it to date despite disruptions related to the COVID- pandemic. In  Bangladesh together with India and Nepal launched a Regional Kala-azar Elimination Initiative with the aim of wiping out the disease. The Government of Bangladesh WHO the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases TDR and several other partners supported research and development of new diagnostic tools effective treatments and vector control especially indoor residual spraying  and facilitated their roll-out and access by all those in need through donation programmes which helped the country meet the criteria set by WHO for elimination as a public health problem  . Kala azar is the most severe form of leishmaniasis and is transmitted by sandflies it is commonly prevalent among the most disadvantaged rural communities. The disease leads to symptoms such as fever weight loss and spleen and liver enlargement and if left untreated can prove fatal in over % of cases. In  Bangladesh was also validated as the fourth country in the WHO South-East Asia Region to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem after Maldives Sri Lanka and Thailand. Lymphatic filariasis also known as elephantiasis occurs when filarial parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquito bites. The infection is usually acquired in childhood with painful and disfiguring visible manifestations appearing much later in life often in the form of enlargement of body parts causing pain severe disability and associated stigma. Lymphatic filariasis was a major public health problem in Bangladesh and was endemic in of its districts. In  the country established a national elimination programme. Between and  high-coverage mass drug administration campaigns were carried out in all endemic districts. A series of transmission assessment surveys was carried out by programme personnel between and  which demonstrated that transmission levels were below the threshold established by WHO for elimination as a public health problem. To meet WHO’s validation criteria on morbidity management and disability prevention   Bangladesh also strengthened access to the recommended essential package of care in all endemic districts. Notably over   people affected by lymphatic filariasis have been trained in self-care and provided with kits to manage their disease condition and improve their quality of life. For both kala azar and lymphatic filariasis Bangladesh will now focus on post-validation surveillance to sustain its hard-won status and prevent recurrence of infection. Source WHO   .

Antimicrobial resistance AMR affects countries in all regions and at all income levels. It is a complex problem that requires both sector-specific actions in the human health food production animal and environmental sectors and a coordinated approach across these sectors. In  the World Health Assembly adopted the Global Action Plan on AMR  committing among other things to the development and implementation of multisectoral national action plans  . As of November  some countries had such plans developed. However in only % of countries reported implementing their national action plans effectively and only % had allocated national budgets to do so  .SDG indicator .d. is defined as the percentage of bloodstream infections due to selected antimicrobial-resistant organisms. Median resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in Escherichia coli E. coli and methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus S. aureus were % and % in  respectively compared with .% and .% in . However no conclusions can be made on whether changes in resistance have occurred over time. The reasons for this are twofold first the pool of reporting countries has changed significantly over the years. In  only countries contributed data on resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in E. coli compared with in . Similarly only countries provided data in on methicillin resistance in S. aureus in  compared with in . Second  the number of resource-limited settings providing data has increased in recent years. Testing coverage in these settings is often low with data often limited to tertiary referral private hospitals and or research facilities  and biased towards complex infections and treatment failures. Higher median resistance in recent years is at least in part consistent with potential biases resulting from the convenience sampling of health facilities for reporting AMR data in many settings  . Priorities to address AMR include surveillance of antimicrobial consumption. The Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System GLASS provides a common and standardized set of methods for measuring and reporting. Of the countries with data –   % achieved the target of at least % of total antibiotic consumption being “Access” group antibiotics  . The overall goal is to reduce the use of “Watch and reserve” group antibiotics and to increase the relative benefit and the availability of Access group antibiotics where needed. Health-related SDGs . Risk factors for health Many factors affect the health of individuals and communities. A risk factor for health is any attribute  characteristic or exposure of an individual that increases their likelihood of developing a disease or injury. This section presents progress towards achieving SDG and GPW targets related to several risk factors for health. .. Nutritional risk factors Better nutrition is related to improved infant child and maternal health stronger immune systems lower risk of NCDs and longevity. Today the world faces the multiple burden of malnutrition that comprises undernutrition overweight including obesity and micronutrient deficiencies. Section . discusses the global trends in undernutrition and overweight or obesity. This section summarizes the global progress towards the reduction of anaemia among women and the consumption of trans-fatty acids TFA . Anaemia among women Women with anaemia are more likely to experience fatigue and impaired physical capacity in their daily lives. Moderate and severe anaemia are also risk factors for adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. Global trends in the prevalence of anaemia among all women – years of age SDG indicator .. show no significant change from .% UI .–. in to .% UI .–. in . With population growth  the total number of women aged – years affected increased from  million in to  million in . While there was a slight decrease in anaemia prevalence among pregnant women from .% UI  .–. in to .% UI .–. in  prevalence among non-pregnant women remained stagnant at .% UI .–. in and .% UI  .–. in  . Across WHO regions the decline in anaemia prevalence among women observed during the MDG era either halted or slowed after . This latest evidence suggests that the global target of % reduction of anaemia in women of reproductive age by  from a baseline is unlikely to be met   . Trans-fatty acids Intake of TFA is associated with increased risk of heart attacks and death from coronary heart disease. WHO designated TFA elimination as one of its priority targets in  calling for the global elimination of industrially produced TFA by . Mandatory TFA policies are currently in effect in  countries in all WHO regions covering % of the global population . billion people . Of these countries  have “best-practice” policies which include mandatory national limit of  g of industrially produced TFA per  g of total fat in all foods and mandatory national ban on the production or use of partially hydrogenated oils as an ingredient in all foods. Population coverage by best-practice TFA policies has grown considerably. In  best-practice policies were in effect for just % of the global population  million people . By the end of  this has increased to % coverage . billion people  . However accelerated actions are needed to meet the target of % global population coverage  . .. Behavioural risk factors Modifiable behaviours such as tobacco use alcohol consumption physical inactivity and an unhealthy diet are among the known risk factors associated with NCDs. This section summarizes the global progress towards the reduction of tobacco use and alcohol consumption. Tobacco use The Global action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs – which has been extended until  includes a target for reducing the global prevalence of tobacco use by % by the year  relative to   .

It acknowledges the importance of health systems strengthening based on a primary health care PHC approach which is critical not just for centring people and communities but also for effective health emergency prevention preparedness response and recovery which has never been more salient than during the COVID- pandemic.UHC grounded in the principle that all individuals and communities should have access to quality essential health services throughout the entire spectrum of care without enduring financial hardships not only contributes to improving health outcomes SDG  but also plays a pivotal role in other SDGs including economic growth and job creation SDG  gender equality SDG  education SDG  nutrition SDG  and poverty reduction SDG . Strengthening health systems and enhancing the sustainability and equity of health services and financing models are pivotal factors that contribute to the successful achievement of UHC. This section delves into SDG indicators related to service delivery and health financing illustrating disparities across WHO regions and World Bank country income groups. Health-related SDGs .. Service delivery Service delivery the primary interface between health systems and people includes a wide range of health service providers but also public health-care institutions and other actors responsible for essential public health functions and provision of health-care products. Scaling up the coverage of essential health services with an emphasis  on PHC Scaling up the coverage of effective essential health services is a fundamental strategy for achieving UHC. It aims not only to improve health outcomes but also to promote health equity and ensure that health care is universally accessible and of high quality. SDG indicator .. referred to as the UHC service coverage index aims to measure the average coverage of essential services through a single index score based on indicators across four domains reproductive maternal newborn and child health RMNCH  infectious diseases NCDs and service capacity and access. This  Achieving the –– targets requires that % of people living with HIV know their HIV status % of people who know their status are receiving ART  and % of people on ART have suppressed viral loads. This translates to % of people living with HIV knowing their HIV status % of people living with HIV receiving ART  and % of people living with HIV having suppressed viral loads.score increased remarkably from to between  and globally but progress has slowed since and even stagnated during the COVID- pandemic. The highest index scores were in the European Region the Region of the Americas and the Western Pacific Region  around  followed by South-East Asia   Eastern Mediterranean  and African regions  . Figure . shows the scores by country in  . The most significant improvements in the average coverage of essential health services occurred in the infectious diseases domain. HIV antiretroviral therapy ART treatment coverage increased from % UI –% in to % UI –% in  yet still far from the –– targets for  – . There were also improvements in TB treatment coverage over the same period from % UI –% in to % UI –% in  with an apparent rebound in and after the sharp reversal of progress in  %  UI –% due to disruptions caused by the COVID- pandemic  . ITN use to prevent malaria also increased between and  from % UI –% to % UI –%  although a stagnation was observed after  . Figure . UHC service coverage index by country  Source WHO and World Bank  . World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals In the area of RMNCH the proportion of women of reproductive age having their need for family planning met with modern methods SDG indicator .. saw a modest uptick from % in to % in  still far from the target of universal access by  . Similarly the proportion of children who received three doses of the vaccine against diphtheria tetanus and pertussis DTP  SDG indicator .b. – DTP rose from % in to % in . However a notable  percentage points coverage drop occurred between  and  followed by a  percentage points increase in . The coverage of the two doses of the vaccine for measles SDG indicator .b. – MCV  and three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine  SDG indicator .b. – PCV also increased reaching % and % respectively in  with stagnations observed in –. In contrast global coverage of Human papillomavirus HPV vaccine SDG indicator .b. – HPV  critical for women’s and girls’ health globally only reached % in  with countries having introduced the HPV vaccine in their national immunization services by the end of . The % target set by the Immunization Agenda is unlikely to be met for any of these vaccinations if current trends continue   . Moreover while there has been a positive increase in the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel SDG indicator ..  rising from % in to % in and notably improving outcomes in childbirth it is important to acknowledge a slowdown in the pace of progress since  and the global target of % coverage by is unlikely to be met unless progress is accelerated   . Positive advancements have been observed in service coverage of NCDs which continue to contribute the highest proportion of the disease burden. For example  according to the latest estimates the proportion of adults aged – years receiving treatment for hypertension increased from % in to % in . The effective coverage for hypertension treatment is estimated to have more than doubled from % to % over the same period  . Data on treatment coverage for alcohol and drug use disorders between and range from extremely low .% to a maximum of % for drug use disorders and % for alcohol use disorders in the countries that were able to report these data in . To address challenges in estimating treatment coverage for substance use disorders SDG indicator ..  a service capacity index has been introduced as a complementary measure index range – . This index varied significantly among countries with values ranging from to in . The highest index values were observed in the European Region   while the lowest were in the African Region   .In most settings efficiency and equity in the delivery of health services requires an increased emphasis on frontline services particularly PHC. Increasing the recruitment  development training and retention of the health workforce Health workers are the cornerstone of a resilient health system and the demand for health workers continues to increase as global health challenges become more complex and the world’s population grows and ages. To make progress towards UHC it is critical to address the global shortage of health workers so that adequate numbers of health workers are available in the right quantity in the right places in alignment with population health needs  . Based on the latest data available over the period – for each country low-income countries had the lowest health worker density and distribution SDG indicator .c. with a median of only . medical doctors interquartile range [IQR] .–.  . IQR .–. nursing and midwifery personnel  . dentists IQR .–. and . IQR .–.  pharmacists per  population compared with medians of . IQR .–.  . IQR .–.  . IQR .–. and . IQR .–.  respectively  in high-income countries. An analysis of countries with available data over three consecutive time periods  – – – reveals a consistent increase in the density and distribution of health workers across all income groups except for dentists in low-income and lower-middle-income countries and pharmacists in middle-income countries Fig. .  . However even when national densities seem adequate  disparities persist at subnational level. Improving access to medicines and health technologies To achieve equitable access to medicines and health technologies major attention is required to this subsystem within health systems. Since  the proportion of health facilities that have a core set of relevant essential medicines available and affordable on a sustainable basis SDG indicator .b. has been estimated for only countries in the WHO Africa Region  Region of the Americas and European Region with a median value of % across the countries IQR –%   . Work is ongoing to improve the methodology to measure access to essential medicines and other health- care products to enable sustained global monitoring. The COVID- pandemic highlighted the huge and growing divide between high- and low-income countries in accessing medicines and health-care products and the need for innovation and local production to enhance the equitable distribution of health-care products i.e. medicines vaccines diagnostics and devices  .

Implementing the International Health Regulations IHR and service delivery models that promote resilience The ability to prevent detect and respond to health emergencies is a critical component of UHC. Service delivery models that are truly fit for purpose need to be equipped to implement the IHR and to develop a clear sense of the types of threats they may face and to prepare for them. The IHR States Parties Self-Assessment Annual Report  SPAR tool consists of indicators for the IHR capacities needed to detect assess notify report and respond to public health risks and acute events of domestic and international concern SDG indicator .d. . Based on the analysis of the latest annual reporting data the top challenges at the global level are policy legal and normative instruments to implement IHR C.  chemical events C.  radiation emergencies C. and human resources C.  while the top strengths are laboratory C.  surveillance C.  health emergency management  C. and health services provision C . The European Region had the highest scores for the capacities related to zoonotic diseases C.  food safety C.  chemical events C. and radiation emergencies C.  while the South-East Asia Region did particularly well for capacities related to policy legal and normative instruments to implement IHR C. and coordination and advocacy C. . The African Region had the lowest scores for all capacities with the exception of zoonotic diseases C.  Fig. .  . SPAR serves as a barometer for a nation’s preparedness and response and helps understand not only national capacities in health security but also how they fit in a regional and international context.

Towards stronger health security in the Pacific island countries Understanding the national capacities in health security in a regional and international context is especially important in regions that face distinctive health security challenges such as the South Pacific. The South Pacific spans one third of the Earth’s surface yet it is inhabited by less than % of the global population. The remoteness of the region often functions as a gatekeeper for infectious diseases but makes it more likely for outbreaks of waterborne and foodborne diseases. The South Pacific is prone to extreme weather events such as cyclones and flooding which are increasing in intensity and frequency. Additionally the South Pacific’s rising sea levels exceed the global mean rate reaching about mm per year  further increasing the region’s vulnerability  . Until  a limited number of Pacific island countries submitted a SPAR regularly making it difficult to identify address and strengthen health security in the region. In August  thirteen Pacific island countries committed to bolstering health security reporting mechanisms during a meeting of Pacific IHR national focal points. One of the Pacific island countries with a complex set of challenges is Kiribati which comprises atolls scattered across the equator and over  million square kilometres of water. In addition to infectious diseases  natural disasters such as the drought and the cyclone Pam have severely impacted Kiribati’s health security. The drought affected water and food access for  of the  people in Kiribati while cyclone Pam caused widespread flooding and damage including in the capital Tarawa   . In preparation for Kiribati’s Ministry of Health to submit IHR SPAR a multisectoral consultation was organized in collaboration with WHO in December . The involvement of representatives from different sectors such as emergency response agriculture financing and legislation helped to ensure that the SPAR scores accurately reflected the country’s situation. By February  Kiribati – together with other Pacific island countries Cook Islands Fiji Marshall Islands  the Federated States of Micronesia Nauru Niue Palau Samoa Solomon Islands Tonga Vanuatu – submitted their SPARs. This has been the highest number of SPAR submissions in the region so far shedding light on areas for improvement. Areas with the biggest gaps in the South Pacific scoring on average less than out of points per area are policy legal and normative instruments to implement IHR infection prevention and control IPC  points of entry PoEs and border health health services provision zoonotic diseases food safety chemical events and radiation emergencies. Countries also declared gaps in financing human resources IHR coordination national IHR Focal Point functions and advocacy. Kiribati SPAR results in identified areas where more attention would be needed in cross-sectoral approaches including for zoonotic diseases radiation emergencies and chemical events Fig. . . The review process for completing the SPAR helped to map out where there were capacity gaps and opportunities for strengthening in coming years. Recognizing the importance of IHR Kiribati integrates the SPAR score average as one of the indicators in its National Health Strategic Plan – with the assessment as the baseline Fig. . . There is a commitment in the National Health Strategic Plan to improve on the SPAR score in the coming four years with annual monitoring.

Health financing Health financing arrangements determine the ability of health systems to respond to health needs pool financial risks and operate efficiently and equitably. They span choices and decisions in three interlinked financing functions – mobilizing resources pooling them and using them to strategically purchase health services. Mobilizing resources and prioritizing health The Addis Ababa Action Agenda AAAA recognized that the primary mechanism for meeting resource needs for achieving the SDGs should be domestic  . In  global government health spending the health component of SDG indicator .a. surged except in low-income countries Fig. . . High- and upper-middle-income nations increased health priority due to COVID--related expenditures. In lower-middle-income countries slower growth in health spending compared with general government spending resulted in reduced health priority in almost half of them though outliers boosted the average. Among low-income countries half saw declining health priority as reduced government health spending coincided with higher general spending. External aid likely played a significant role in financing health-care expenses related to the COVID- pandemic in low- and lower-middle-income nations echoing a trend where higher external funding in low-income countries correlated with lower health priority in government budgets during the MDG period  .Development assistance for health DAH  to complement domestic financing As part of the AAAA countries committed to reverse the decline in aid to the poorest and fragile countries  many of which will require sustained DAH to address capacity constraints and continue progress toward UHC. However DAH must add to domestic resources rather than crowding them out and support efforts to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of domestic resources utilization. In  the African Region received the highest weighted average health ODA per capita US$ . compared with countries in other regions less than US$  per capita  SDG indicator .b.  . While DAH has undeniably contributed to noteworthy health improvements the current architecture and incentives associated with such assistance have inadvertently led many nations to neglect funding for basic health services in their own budgets and become overly aid-dependent  . The COVID- pandemic has shown the perils of overdependence on external sources of finance and distant suppliers for critical health needs  . Improve financial protection for all Expanding pooling arrangements is essential to provide protection from the economic consequences of ill health and enhance equity in service use – to reduce foregone care for financial reasons financial hardship due to out- of-pocket OOP health payments and indebtedness due to health cost. In many countries direct household OOP Health-related SDGs Figure .

The largest shares were reported in the Western Pacific Region .% and South-East Asia Region .%  the lowest shares were reported in the Region of the Americas .% and the European Region .%  . Even prior to the COVID- pandemic and despite long- standing high-level commitments to health for all and UHC progress was largely off-track. Many governments have neglected foundational investments in health systems. Consequently health services have been disrupted and inequities between and within countries have worsened during the COVID- pandemic. Achieving UHC requires targeted resource allocation and a renewed commitment to building resilient health systems that prioritize access to essential services for the poor and most vulnerable.

Among the health-related SDG indicators reviewed in this report  have numeric SDG or other global targets. None of these targets has been achieved thus far and none is likely to be met if current trends continue. However most of the indicators  out of  are showing progress in the right direction globally the remaining indicators are either moving in the wrong direction or cannot be assessed due to limited data. New and refocused commitment and capacities at national regional and global levels are key to accelerate progress and reverse worrying trends. Health-related SDGs References .

World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals   Progress towards WHO Triple Billion targets The WHO Triple Billion targets outlined in and as the foundation of the WHO GPW are a set of ambitious goals aimed at improving global health by  one billion more people benefitting from UHC one billion more people better protected from health emergencies and one billion more people enjoying better health and well-being   . Functioning as both an impact measurement tool and a policy strategy they are an integral part of the GPW Results Framework. The targets focus on achieving measurable impacts on people’s health at the country regional and global levels. They are tangible related to human lives and able to drive changes.Triple Billion targets are based on outcome indicators to track the progress that WHO and its Member States achieve in improving population health at the country level. The indicators include SDG indicators and seven non-SDG indicators approved by WHO Member States to address country priorities during the nd World Health Assembly WHA  in   . The close alignment between the Triple Billion and SDGs enables countries to apply Triple Billion targets in delivering their commitments on the SDGs. Triple Billion projections were calculated for the years – relative to a baseline providing much- needed milestones for progress made at the global  regional and country levels in providing promoting and protecting global health. This chapter focuses on the global and regional results to date  . Overall the world has collectively achieved the healthier population billion target but is lagging on the other two billions.

UHC billion The UHC billion is for improvement in the number of people having access to essential health services but without inflicting financial hardship. The calculation of progress towards the UHC billion relied on the assessment of two components   average service coverage measured through tracer indicators and   financial hardship measured through an indicator of catastrophic health spending defined as the proportion of population whose household expenditure on health is greater than % of total household expenditure or income. By  there were only  million more people benefitting from UHC without incurring catastrophic health spending compared with  not even reaching half of the UHC billion target. The projection for  is a mere  million suggesting that the world is seriously off the mark in achieving the UHC billion target. The impact of COVID- pandemic was salient as the UHC billion reduced or stalled in and before reversing the negative trend in . The situation called for accelerated efforts and dramatic changes in public policies to expand UHC  . Among the six WHO regions the Region of the Americas was the only region where the number of people benefitting from UHC decreased in and compared with  Fig. . .

Health emergencies protection billion The health emergencies protection HEP billion aims to have one billion more people better protected from health emergencies. The index for this billion was calculated based on SDG by measuring three indices  i emergency preparation  ii emergency prevention and  iii emergency detection and responses. At the global level there has been consistent improvement in the HEP billion since  Fig. . . However such progress is still not sufficient to achieve the HEP billion target by . Progress towards the HEP billion even stalled or regressed in and  in multiple WHO regions. The Region of the Americas saw a downward trend starting from that extended through .

Health-related SDGs and health information system The Triple Billion targets leverage the global and national commitments to meet the health-related SDGs. Given the centrality of the health-related SDGs in the Triple Billion target construct the Triple Billion target projections allow WHO and its Member States to assess their progress towards the targets for SDG indicators. The projected Triple Billion progress since  the first year of the GPW showed that significant progress has been achieved for all three of the billions particularly the HPOP billion as the world has likely already achieved the target of having one billion more people living healthier lives by  Fig. . . However such progress is far from sufficient to ensure the health-related SDG targets are achieved globally.

Source WHO  . The world needs to intensify efforts to achieve the health- related SDG targets by  which is vital for building healthier more equitable and prosperous societies globally. For such efforts timely and accurate monitoring of the progress based on robust data is vital for effective policy changes and interventions. However lack of timely reporting and delay in producing health estimates using the most recent empirical data could bring great challenges in delivering accurate assessment for many health outcomes. Figure . shows the percentage of UHC service coverage index tracers for which primary data were available for years –. It is evident that most indicators suffered from a data shortage at various degrees across countries. A lot could be done to enhance the data input for the Triple Billion computation. More often than not the lack of data will not be limited to the data required by the Triple Billion rather it is deeply entrenched in poorly performing health information systems. Thus efforts should be made to strengthen the general health information systems in countries to generate reliable data for the effective tracking of and policy changes regarding health-related SDGs. WHO is committed to work with Member States to strengthen their system capacity to collect analyse and use health data. Various tools have been developed by WHO to enhance countries’ data capacity. For example  the WHO SCORE for health data technical package was designed to assess the performance of national health information systems identify the data gaps and provide a toolbox to improve various areas of a functioning health information system  . The Data management competency framework DMCF developed by the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific is another example of such a tool it enables health information managers to identify capacity gaps and drive competency development at various levels Box . .

Strategic and integrated capacity-building of the health information workforce in the Western Pacific Region Strategic use of data for decision-making is critical for measuring and driving progress towards global and national health indicator targets. Capacity limitations of health information workers HIW often hinder the ability to effectively produce and use health data despite significant improvements in health information systems. HIWs often do not possess the required capacities to participate consistently and in a timely manner in the data management cycle. To systematically assess such capacity gaps the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific with support from WHO headquarters country offices and in collaboration with partner organizations launched the DMCF in May   . This framework is a comprehensive integrated and coherent tool that can be used to define and assess current and future competency needs of HIWs across the region and beyond. This tool will enable health information managers in countries to identify capacity gaps and plan and drive the competency development of their HIWs across different levels of their health system. Papua New Guinea has set out a clear path as the first country to adopt the framework. As a direct outcome of a national health information workshop held in October  Papua New Guinea National Department of Health collaborated with WHO to establish a standardized set of competencies required for health information positions at both national and provincial levels based on the ideally required skills and competencies spelled out in the WHO DMCF. These competency profiles are invaluable as they provide a clear foundation for developing tools to assess training needs and formulating comprehensive long-term capacity-building strategies. The national data management competency profiles were officially launched together with the Provincial Health Authority Monitoring & Evaluation toolkit in September . China followed suit by identifying the framework’s value in improving health information workforce capacity in a systematic and sustainable manner. The Center for Health Statistics and Information of the National Health Commission of China collaborated with WHO in translating the framework into Chinese and conducted a series of workshops at both national and provincial levels in preparation for conducting competency gap assessments among different types of health workers across different provinces. The adoption of the framework in Papua New Guinea and China serves as pivotal examples highlighting how the WHO DMCF could be applied to each Member State’s unique context. This ability to contextualize and apply the framework is essential given the diverse nature of Member States’ health information systems and their diverse priorities and needs in addressing both present and future health challenges. Progress towards WHO Triple Billion targets . Conclusion The WHO Triple Billion is a framework and a strategy aiming to drive timely improvement of global health. The targets although set at the global level were simply the aggregation of country-level estimates that were calculated based on underlying tracer indicators. The Triple Billion projections provide WHO its Member States and partners with the much-needed assessment of progress towards fulfilling their commitment on Triple Billion targets and the health-related SDGs. Tracer indicators are the cornerstone of the Triple Billion targets but also a critical tool for countries to identify and prioritize strategies to enhance the health of their populations. By examining the projected contributions at indicator level policy-makers can make informed course adjustments to achieve the SDGs set by the global community.As the GPW is drawing to a close in  continuous tracking of the Triple Billion targets and a proper transition from GPW to GPW is vital for WHO to ensure accountability adaptability and efficiency in achieving the ambitious goals it set jointly with its Member States. All three levels of WHO – headquarters regional and country offices – should make every effort to align their priorities. Through these priorities that will be reflected in the new programmatic and outcome indicators for the upcoming GPW WHO will reaffirm its commitment to address evolving global health needs enhance collaboration with stakeholders and strengthen its role in advancing global health equity and security. Committed investment in improving data and health information systems across the globe will be essential for such endeavours. References .

World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals   Key issues and trends in global health The global population and economic growth the advancement of science and technology and the ever- increasing interconnectedness of the world have brought about enormous societal changes along with unprecedented progress but also multiple and complex challenges affecting the health of billions of people worldwide. This chapter looks at selected key global health issues such as the double burden of malnutrition where undernutrition coexists in parallel with overweight and obesity globally. It also highlights the health challenges faced by persons with disabilities and refugees and international migrants.. The double burden of malnutrition Combating malnutrition in all its forms is one of the greatest global health challenges. Today the world faces the double burden of malnutrition characterized by the coexistence of undernutrition along with overweight and obesity within individuals households and populations  and across the life course. This section highlights the global and regional trends in the population-level burden of stunting wasting and overweight among children under  years of age and the double burden of thinness or underweight and obesity among older children adolescents and adults. Box . summarizes the definitions of the indicators of malnutrition used in this section. Child stunting stems from poor nutrition during pregnancy and early childhood. It can lead to severe physical and cognitive damage that may last a lifetime. A child who is moderately or severely wasted due to recent rapid weight loss or a failure to gain weight has an increased risk of death. In contrast a child may be overweight due to excessive caloric intake which may be due to poor access to nutritious foods consumption of nutrient-poor ultra-processed foods and or inadequate physical activity. In childhood and adolescence obesity is associated with greater risks and earlier onset of various NCDs such as type diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In addition children and teenagers living with obesity may experience psychosocial consequences from stigma discrimination and bullying. Undernutrition as measured by thinness among children aged – years lowers learning potential weakens the immune system and increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Micronutrient deficiencies and anaemia in adolescent girls amplify the risk of life-threatening complications during pregnancy and childbirth. In adults obesity is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality from a variety of NCDs such as cardiovascular diseases diabetes cancers neurological disorders chronic respiratory diseases and digestive disorders. Undernutrition in adults as captured by the underweight indicator is critical for adult women during pregnancy with repercussions for both mother and child. In older adults undernutrition can lead to increased risk of impaired immune response and physical and cognitive impairment. In turn ageing brings physiological changes with sensory impairment poor oral health isolation loneliness and depression which further exacerbate the risk of undernutrition. Box .

World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals .. The magnitude of the problem In  an estimated  million UI – million  children under  years of age globally were affected by stunting too short for age and  million UI – million were affected by wasting too thin for height  revealing the vast extent of undernutrition among the youngest population. However an estimated  million  UI – million children under  years of age were overweight in  . In the same year among older children and adolescents aged – years an estimated  million UI – million were living with thinness while  million  UI – million were living with obesity. Among adults aged years and older an estimated  million were underweight while  million were living with obesity. This means that over one billion people aged  years and older worldwide are living with obesity while over half a billion others are living with underweight or thinness  . These numbers along with the health implications described above indicate that the world is dealing with a public health problem not only at a massive scale but also a complex one... Stunting wasting and overweight among children under  years of age Undernutrition among children under  years of age globally as reflected by the number affected by stunting and wasting has declined in the past three decades. The number affected by stunting declined from  million UI – million in to  million  UI – million in . Over the same period the number affected by wasting declined from  million  UI – million to  million UI – million  and the number of overweight rose from  million UI  – million to  million UI – million  .

Key issues and trends in global health At this pace of change the world is off-track to meet the global targets to halve the number of children under  years of age affected by stunting from the  baseline and to reduce the prevalence of wasting and overweight to less than %   . Almost all WHO regions are experiencing a considerable burden of both undernutrition in the form of stunting and wasting and overweight among the youngest population. In the South-East Asia Region the prevalence of overweight nearly doubled in the past three decades  reaching .% UI .–.% in  while the prevalence of wasting continued to be the highest across all WHO regions despite having declined from .% UI .–.% in to .% UI .–.% in . This means that in almost one in five .% children in this region were either too thin or too heavy for their height. In addition three out of  .% UI .–.% children were affected by stunting even though its prevalence had halved since when it stood at .% UI .–.%  Fig. .  . In the Eastern Mediterranean Region approximately the same proportion of children were affected by wasting .% UI .–.% and overweight .% UI .–.% in  while a quarter .% UI .–.% of all children under  years of age were affected by stunting.

However about one in  .% UI .–.% children in this region were affected by stunting that year  Fig. . . Peru is notable both regionally and globally for a massive reduction in stunting prevalence Box .  . Box . A dramatic reduction in childhood stunting in Peru Since  few countries have reduced the prevalence of stunting among children under years of age as dramatically as Peru. It is estimated to have declined from a very high prevalence of .% UI .–.% in  to .% UI .–.% in  which is considered a medium prevalence. The ARR .% per year substantially surpasses that in the Region of the Americas .% per year as well as in the upper-middle-income countries .% per year  Fig. .   . An analysis of drivers of the decline in stunting prevalence in Peru from to identified multiple determinants of stunting reduction including socioeconomic class parental education parental health and differences in maternal and newborn health care. Reducing the equity gap contributed greatly to this reduction  with the greatest reductions observed in the lowest wealth quintile in rural areas and among children with the least-educated mothers. The slope index of inequality a measure of absolute wealth-related inequality indicates that the gap in stunting prevalence among children under years of age between the richest and poorest households reduced by half between and  leading to greater equity. Peru’s experience offers useful lessons in tackling the problem of stunting with the participation of multiple sectors  . Figure .

This means that obesity has taken over the dominance in the double burden of malnutrition among adults globally in the past three decades Fig. .  .Obesity prevalence among adults aged years and older increased in all WHO regions. The Region of the Americas and the Eastern Mediterranean Region have experienced the largest absolute increase in obesity prevalence since  leading to the highest obesity prevalence across WHO regions in  affecting one third of adults in the Region of the Americas and almost three in in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. In the European Region the . percentage point increase in the double burden was due entirely to the rise in obesity prevalence as thinness prevalence remained low. About half of the double burden in the African Region was due to obesity in  up from about one fifth in . The Western Pacific Region remained the region with the lowest combined prevalence of underweight and obesity among adults but obesity is becoming dominant. Underweight prevalence decreased markedly in the South-East Asia Region from .% UI .–.% in to .% UI .–.% in  driving the only decrease of the double burden among adults across all WHO regions.

Source NCD Risk Factor Collaboration  .  Key issues and trends in global health .. Double-duty actions to tackle the double burden of malnutrition The coexistence of undernutrition overweight and obesity can be addressed by taking advantage of the shared drivers across forms of malnutrition including biological environmental and social factors to design and implement policies and programmes using a life- course multi-generational approach. These double- duty actions are evidence-based efficient and effective interventions that can make the most of often limited time fiscal and human resources. Common delivery platforms that can be leveraged for double-duty actions include national dietary guidelines health systems urban food systems humanitarian settings and social policies – . Double-duty actions need not necessarily be new actions. Rather policy-makers can capitalize on existing government buy-in and resources by reviewing and refocusing existing food and agriculture policies. They often already exist to address single forms of malnutrition but need to be refocused to address multiple forms simultaneously. Strong opportunities for double-duty actions include the following examples school feeding programmes that focus only on addressing undernutrition or overweight can be redesigned to ensure that they instead provide and promote a healthy diet scaling up the WHO antenatal care recommendations protecting and promoting breastfeeding revising complementary feeding guidelines and educating care-givers on the risks of unhealthy complementary foods designing social support and welfare programmes to reduce risks from unhealthy foods and ensuring that food systems and food environment policies facilitate the purchase and consumption of a healthy diet by increasing access to and attractiveness of nutritious foods. Nutrition and food safety are closely interlinked and essential for achieving positive health outcomes from food systems. There is a linkage between subclinical infection with enteropathogens and stunting   . Food must be safe available accessible nutritious  culturally acceptable and ingested regularly to ensure growth health and well-being. Unsafe food increases infection and intoxication creating a vicious cycle of disease malnutrition and disability particularly affecting vulnerable groups. . Disability-related health inequities Disability results from the interaction between health conditions and or impairments that a person experiences such as dementia blindness or spinal cord injury and a range of contextual factors related to different environmental and personal factors including societal attitudes access to infrastructure discriminatory policies  poverty age and gender. This understanding of disability is grounded in the WHO International classification of functioning disability and health ICF  published in  . According to the WHO Global report on health equity for persons with disabilities  approximately . billion persons in – about % of the global population – had disability. The global number of persons with disabilities has increased substantially in the past decade due to demographic and epidemiological changes such as population growth and the increase in the number of persons with NCDs who are living longer and ageing with limitations in functioning  . Persons with disabilities often experience health inequities due to avoidable unjust and unfair conditions. They die younger have poorer health and increased disease risk and more limitations in their everyday functioning. The contributing factors to these inequities can be i health-system-related factors such as barriers in physical infrastructure and communication negative attitudes by health workers or lack of disability data in the health information system  ii structural factors such as stigma and discrimination  iii social determinants such as poverty and lack of education and iv disease risk factors such as tobacco consumption and obesity. World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals .. Premature mortality among persons with disabilities Data on health inequities in terms of premature mortality among persons with disabilities are scarce. However a growing body of evidence indicates that persons with disabilities have higher rates of premature mortality compared with persons without disabilities  . A systematic review of studies from low- and middle- income countries found that persons with disabilities have double the mortality rates of persons without disabilities  . Premature mortality is even more visible in those that are most marginalized among persons with disabilities. For example evidence from some high-income European countries shows that persons with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities have higher risks of premature mortality compared with the general population – . The COVID- pandemic exacerbated this pattern. A systematic review of studies found that persons with disabilities were almost three times as likely to die from COVID- than persons without disabilities  ... Poorer health and higher disease risk among persons with disabilities Persons with disabilities have in general poorer health and higher risk of developing secondary health conditions  . Data from across European countries collected via the European Health Interview Survey in show that overall compared with persons without disability persons with severe disability are more likely to report having NCDs including chronic respiratory diseases over eight times as likely  coronary heart disease or angina pectoris  times as likely  stroke  times as likely  diabetes almost six times as likely  and depression over eight times as likely . The gap in the self-reported morbidity between persons with and without disability varies greatly across the European countries but morbidity remains consistently higher among persons with disabilities Fig. .  .

Key issues and trends in global health .. Contributing factors to health inequities among persons with disabilities There is a range of contributing factors within and beyond the health system that drive premature mortality and increased morbidity among persons with disabilities. In terms of health-system factors lack of accessible and inclusive health service provision often leaves persons with disabilities behind. A systematic review of  studies from eight high-income countries found that women with disabilities are % less likely to have been screened for breast cancer and % less likely to have been screened for cervical cancer than their non-disabled peers  . Data from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in countries show that children with disabilities are generally at greater risk of missing out on vaccinations  only % of children aged – months with more  than one functional difficulty are fully vaccinated compared with % of children at the same age without disabilities  . Evidence from countries shows that persons with disabilities have lower access to health services than those without disabilities Fig. . . Across these countries the median estimate shows that persons with disabilities are more than four times as likely as persons without disabilities to be unable to get health care when they need it % of persons with disabilities versus % of persons without disabilities indicated that they needed but could not get health care. In eight countries more than % of persons with disabilities were not able to get health care when they needed it   . In European countries costs of services geographical location and long waiting lists which disproportionately affect persons with disabilities are major factors in the lower access to health services. Beyond health-system factors persons with disabilities are also more likely to have risk factors for ill health. Data from European countries show that compared with persons without disabilities persons with severe disabilities are overall three times as likely to self-report having high blood pressure twice as likely to be obese and a third as likely to do regular aerobic physical activity Fig. .  . Very often the reason for the higher risk factor presence in persons with disabilities is the lack of accessible health promotion and prevention strategies which do not allow this population to benefit equally  . Different social determinants also play an important role as factors that drive health inequities among persons with disabilities. Poverty is a solid example to demonstrate this. Poor living conditions and social exclusion add to the risk of poor health and unmet health-care needs among persons with disabilities. Across European countries .% of persons with severe disabilities were at risk of poverty before social transfers  such as benefits allowances and pensions  compared with .% of persons with no disability. Yet even after social transfers poverty risk is still double among persons with disabilities .% compared with .%  Fig. . .

World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals Poverty affects the state of health of persons with disabilities – through inability to afford health-related expenses overcrowded and poor living conditions that contribute to the spread of diseases poor mental health and social exclusion among other factors. According to the analysis from European countries persons with severe disability are overall twice as likely to report having unmet health-care needs due to financial limitations than persons with no disability. They are also almost twice as likely to be unable to meet unexpected financial expenses e.g. having surgery or repairing their house  more likely to be overburdened by housing costs and four times as likely to be living in conditions with  SDG indicator ...

Gaps in formal social support mechanisms may mean that persons with disabilities are reliant on family members for support to engage in health activities and support for their mental health yet the proportion of persons who felt they had  strong social support was overall  percentage points lower among persons with severe disabilities   . Evidence also suggests that compared with persons without disabilities persons with disabilities are at greater risk of violence including IPV  but significant data gaps remain.

Intimate partner violence against women with disabilities A systematic review of studies mainly from high-income countries concluded that the prevalence of all forms of IPV including physical psychological emotional sexual and financial was higher among women with disabilities than among women without disabilities  . Evidence is also emerging from low- and middle-income countries. For example analysis of data from seven violence-prevention programmes in low- and middle-income countries indicated that women with disabilities were nearly twice as likely to report past--month IPV than women without disabilities  . Current estimates are likely significant underestimates as women with disabilities tend to be underrepresented in surveys and may also experience disability-specific types of violence that are often unmeasured. For a better understanding of the risk factors for violence against women and to enable the development of more specialized prevention strategies and response plans it is necessary to improve the inclusion of women with disabilities and the issue of disability within violence against women in population-based surveys and research. WHO recently issued recommendations for good practice in measuring violence against women with disabilities  . .. Towards disability- inclusive and data- informed health systems The way forward to achieve inclusive health systems and leave no one behind includes a systems-level response through strengthening health systems that integrates targeted actions to advance health equity for persons with disabilities. It is essential that the actions that governments take to advance disability inclusion in the health sector are informed by valid and reliable data that allow monitoring and tracking progress. As shown above however data on health inequities among persons with disabilities are scarce. Factors contributing to the inequity are frequently not well captured making it difficult sometimes to explore the drivers of the differences and whether these differences are indeed due to unjust or unfair factors. The collection of data on disability is often deprioritized in many countries consequently the evidence of health inequities and their contributing factors is more limited than for other groups in marginalized situations. However lack of evidence should not be interpreted as a lack of inequities.There is a fundamental need to collect or disaggregate population- and facility-based data based on disability status across the different levels of country health information systems. For example at input level administrative sources such as financial tracking systems databases and records on human resources infrastructure or policies can be used to understand how financing for disability works or whether health facilities are accessible. At output level facility assessments or facility reporting systems can measure availability of services service readiness or quality. At outcome and impact level disability-specific surveys or routine health and demographic surveys that allow disaggregation of data by disability and integrating disability indicators in facility-level data collection can facilitate in-depth understanding of the experiences of persons with disabilities in terms of health-care needs and coverage. Chile is among the countries that have implemented the WHO Model Disability Survey to inform policy Box . . Only through valid and reliable data on disability will countries be able to develop evidenced-based policies to monitor the SDGs to measure progress towards national targets such as UHC and to take stock of the challenges that remain. World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals Box . The role of data in improving the lives of persons with disability in Chile The Model Disability Survey MDS  developed by WHO and the World Bank in  addresses the scarcity of data and often poor quality of information on persons with disabilities in many countries  . The survey takes a broader approach to disability collecting data on functioning and environmental barriers and facilitators. WHO has been supporting the successful implementation of the MDS in more than countries to date providing a comprehensive assessment of the situation of persons with disabilities and contributing to better public policy. Under the leadership of the Ministry of Social Development and Family and the National Disability Service  SENADIS  with participation from the Ministry of Health the WHO MDS was implemented in Chile for the first time in   . Preparation of the survey took more than a year including consultation with persons with disabilities civil society groups their families and supporters across all regions of the country. The survey found that one in six .% people aged  years and older in Chile had disabilities in  .% of adults and .% of children aged – years . An estimated % of adults with disability had a mental or behavioural disorder. It also identified barriers that persons with disability experienced including in health and transport  . The findings informed the development of key legislation plans and actions to address the identified barriers. For example Law . on labour inclusion was implemented setting a labour quota of % for workers with disabilities that all companies with more than workers must meet – with plans dedicated to gradually increase this percentage. Furthermore the results of the study helped design protocols and methodologies to improve the level of participation of persons with disabilities such as the national census that incorporated a protocol to interview persons with disabilities in their homes. In addition the development of the National Mental Health Action Plan which was launched in  and the National Disability Qualification and Certification Plan. More actions were taken towards improving access to health services among persons with disabilities. In addition a decision was taken to include disability questions in the country’s National Health Survey to enable the government to better track progress and understand unmet service needs among persons with disabilities. In line with the WHO recommendation to undertake the MDS every – years to track progress on the situations of persons with disabilities and dependency Chile implemented the survey for a second time in   . The results of the new assessment will help the Government of Chile better understand the impact of disability-related policies and actions that the country has taken and plan next steps towards addressing the needs of persons with disabilities and to monitor the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. . Health of refugees and migrants The number of international migrants increased from  million .% of the global population in  to  million .% of the global population in   . This number does not include internal migrants  which were estimated to be around  million in   . In addition in mid- an estimated  million people were forcibly displaced including those who are internally displaced refugees and asylum seekers  . Migration could either improve or degrade an individual’s health status. Refugees and migrants often face worse health outcomes in countries of transit and destination due to barriers such as language and cultural differences institutional discrimination and restricted use of health services. The first WHO World report on the health of refugees and migrants released in  offers an overview of the health of refugees and international migrants along with the associated determinants and public health challenges while also revealing crucial gaps in global data and knowledge  . Prioritizing the rights of refugees and migrants to timely affordable and dignified health care is essential for achieving health equity. Key issues and trends in global health .. Key issues affecting the health of refugees and migrants Some flows of global migration can be predicted by factors such as economic growth and demographic changes. However displacements due to emergencies arising from disease outbreaks conflicts natural disasters and climate change pose significant challenges. Health and social protection systems need to be prepared for sudden upheaval of populations. New and renewed emergencies are straining health services in all WHO regions. In addition to deaths and injuries the risks of infectious diseases and mental health conditions also increase meanwhile health facilities may be unable to cope as they are heavily affected by power and supply outages or even targeted in conflicts. The threat of malnutrition and starvation exists further down the line as a result of disrupted food supplies  exacerbating critical health needs of already vulnerable populations  . Although a large proportion of refugees and migrants are in generally good health their numbers also include children elderly people persons with disabilities and those whose health has been negatively impacted by their travels or the circumstances in their home country. Some might start a family get sick or get injured in their host country. These health needs transcend national boundaries but many countries restrict health coverage based on immigration status limiting access to health insurance and services and the cost of non-emergency care may be an unaffordable out-of-pocket expense. These factors leave millions in vulnerable situations globally and they may encounter poorer health outcomes particularly in substandard living and working conditions  . For instance studies have found higher rates of anaemia in women and children among refugees and migrants compared with local populations and there is an increased risk of both anaemia and malnutrition in some camp-based settings – . Migrant workers may face discrimination exploitation limited workplace rights and social protection as well as significant occupational health problems such as higher risk of occupational injuries documented particularly among male migrant workers employed in high-risk industries – . During the COVID- pandemic migrant workers in some countries particularly those in low-skilled roles faced heightened exposure risks due to overcrowded living conditions – . Those who were employed in essential sectors such as health care and agriculture bore a disproportionate burden of pandemic-related challenges  – . In addition refugees and migrants may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of AMR during various phases of migration and displacement due to factors such as exposure to infections limited access to diagnostics and therapeutics and inappropriate use of antibiotics  . Figure . Distribution of access to government health services for refugees and migrants across  countries –      Access to all services regardless of migration status Access to all services dependent on migration status Access to emergency health- care services only No access to any health services Proportion of countries % Source  WHO   based on unpublished data from the International Organization for Migration. World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals Yet data on health-care access policies from  countries between and show that only half of them provide refugees and migrants with access to all government-funded health services under the same conditions as nationals regardless of migratory status  see Fig. .  . Available evidence reveals mixed patterns of NCD burden and risks among migrants and refugees compared with host populations. Taking cancer as an example studies from three high-income countries in the Americas suggested better outcomes for migrants with cancer  whereas research from two high-income European countries indicated that cancer was often diagnosed at advanced stages among refugee and migrant populations leading to poorer health outcomes than host populations – . Studies from three African countries underscored gaps in cervical cancer awareness among refugee and migrant women stressing the importance of prevention and early detection interventions – . These challenges are mirrored in other regions with refugee and migrant women facing barriers to HPV vaccination in settings where factors such as clinic accessibility and physician recommendations play significant roles   .

Source Authors’ analysis of data from the European Health Interview Survey and the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions –    . Patterns of inequality in NCD burden and risk factors between migrants and non-migrants varied greatly across European countries reflecting the multifaceted influence of genetic social environmental and other factors that contribute to NCD burden Fig. . . For example the proportion of people reporting a long-standing illness or health problem is more than  percentage points higher among migrants compared with non-migrants in seven countries but is more than  percentage points higher among non-migrants in six other countries. Reported high blood pressure prevalence is more than  percentage points higher among migrant populations in three countries but is more than  percentage points higher among non-migrant populations in seven other countries   .Similarly inequalities in the prevalence of NCD risk factors varied across countries. For example the prevalence of tobacco smoking was over  percentage points higher among migrants in four countries but over  percentage points higher among non-migrants in six countries. In eight countries reported overweight prevalence was at least  percentage points higher among migrant populations  while it was also at least  percentage points higher among non-migrant populations in eight countries   . Therefore inequalities in NCDs between migrants and non-migrants vary significantly across European countries  underscoring the imperative for tailored country-specific investigations into health inequalities and their drivers to inform equity-oriented policies and programmes. World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals .. The need for quality data on refugee and migrant health There is a lack of timely representative and systematically collected disaggregated data on refugee and migrant health in national health information systems. This makes it challenging to understand and address their health needs develop inclusive public health approaches and track progress towards national and global health goals. Data-driven approaches are vital for fostering health equity and social inclusion. Box . shows how mixed-methods data generation provides insights into the health status and needs of refugees from Ukraine in Poland.Recognizing the urgency the WHO Global Action Plan on promoting the health of refugees and migrants emphasizes the collection of high-quality disaggregated data to monitor progress towards implementation of the six priority areas  .

Mixed-methods data-generation approach provides insights into health status and needs of refugees from Ukraine in Poland The outbreak of war in Ukraine in led to an immediate and unprecedented influx of millions of refugees fleeing from Ukraine to other countries in Europe and beyond with Poland hosting up to . million refugees at the height of the crisis. In response to the urgent need for evidence on the health status and needs of refugees Statistics Poland collaborated closely with WHO at country regional and headquarters levels. A mixed-methods approach was adopted in the border provinces of Poland through a representative household survey and behavioural insights research initiated in  and repeated in . With the country’s population surging by over % the Polish authorities prioritized understanding the health needs of the refugees. The results are illustrated in Fig. .  . Even though services were rapidly made available for them the European Union directive that allowed such provision does not necessarily address barriers to access and hence barriers such as language and cultural differences and lack of information hindered and continue to hinder health-care access.

categories of causes of deaths Not only has the pandemic set back healthy longevity worldwide by years it also reversed the previous trends of shifting disease burden to NCDs., Grouping deaths into three broad categories of causes of death – communicable maternal perinatal and nutritional conditions “communicable diseases” hereafter  NCDs  and injuries – clear transition can be noticed well before the pandemic  .Globally NCDs accounted for .% of all deaths in  rising to .% in  while the share of communicable diseases dropped from .% in to .% in  and injuries remained relatively stable around %., As COVID- emerged as a new infectious disease and started to take a toll on human lives the share of deaths due to communicable diseases jumped back to the level .%, in and further back to the level .% in ., Simultaneously the share of NCD deaths dropped to .% in and to .% in  and the share of injury deaths dropped to just about % in both years Fig. .  ., Figure ., Composition of causes

largest share .% of deaths attributable to communicable diseases before the pandemic with NCDs accounting for only about % of all deaths in ., These levels remained largely stable in and  indicating little impact of the COVID- pandemic on the broad distribution of causes of death., Similarly the Western Pacific Region has seen limited change since in the distribution across the three categories with NCDs accounting for about % and communicable diseases for about % of all deaths Fig. .  ., However the pandemic has been more disruptive to the expected trajectories in other WHO regions., The European Region which had the highest share of NCD deaths among all deaths in  .%  experienced an abrupt shift of disease burden back to communicable diseases in and  as the share of NCD deaths dropped to .% in and the share of communicable diseases nearly quadrupled from .% in to .% in ., Other WHO regions also experienced sizable reversed shift of disease burden from NCDs and injuries back to communicable diseases leading to increases in its share ranging from about % Eastern Mediterranean Region  to % South-East Asia Region  ., Similar disparity was also observed across World Bank income groups Fig. . ., Bearing the largest share nearly % of deaths due to communicable diseases low-income countries saw minimal change in the distribution of deaths from the three broad groups

combination of transitioning cause-of-death profiles and changing population structure., Examining age-standardized death rates ASDR exhibits more clearly the progress achieved prior to the COVID- pandemic and the setback it caused., Globally the ASDR from communicable diseases was cut by about half from ., UI .–. to .  , UI .–. per  population in –., Yet  the pandemic brought back the rate to

doubled in the same period., In comparison the African and Western Pacific regions only experienced moderate increases .% and .% increase respectively  ., Progress was also made in all WHO regions in – for mortality from NCDs except for the South-East Asia Region and mortality from injuries except for the Eastern Mediterranean Region  leading to .% reduction in ASDR from NCDs and .% reduction in

all World Bank income groups with sizable reductions observed in ASDR for all three broad cause categories in – and little excess change brought by the pandemic in and for NCDs and injuries., The COVID- pandemic reversed the declining trend in ASDR for communicable diseases in all income groups to the extent that the level in that was above the level in upper-income countries and nearly double the level in high-income countries thus undoing over two decades of work  ., Life expectancy healthy life expectancy and burden of disease.., Leading causes of death Looking at the leading causes of death there was also a clear transition from communicable causes to NCDs., Globally five of the leading causes in were communicable and four were NCDs with road injury being the only injury cause Fig.

malaria cases and % of global malaria deaths., Children under the age of five are particularly vulnerable in  almost four in every five malaria deaths in the region were among these young children  ., WHO recently added the programmatic use of malaria vaccines for children living in endemic areas to the malaria prevention toolbox., The first malaria vaccine RTS S AS RTS S  was recommended by WHO in after successful pilot programmes in Ghana Kenya and Malawi through the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme Box . ., In  WHO recommended a second safe and effective malaria vaccine R-Matrix-M R  ., Wide implementation of malaria vaccines is expected to save tens of thousands of lives each year., Box ., Malaria vaccine implementation in Ghana Kenya and Malawi, The Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme MVIP was established by WHO to evaluate the public health use of the first malaria vaccine RTS S AS  ., Findings from the pilot programme informed the historic WHO recommendation in October for a vaccine to prevent malaria in children., Through the collaborative effort with the ministries of health in Ghana Kenya and Malawi from to  the RTS S malaria vaccine was integrated into routine child immunization services as part of each country’s national malaria control programme., Over million children received the RTS S malaria vaccine through the pilot., Findings from MVIP show that the RTS S vaccine substantially reduces early childhood deaths and hospitalizations for severe malaria., In October  WHO recommended a second safe and effective malaria vaccine R for routine use., This recommendation resulting in sufficient vaccine supply to scale up malaria vaccines broadly coupled with the high impact seen with the introduction of the RTS S vaccine underscores the potential of malaria vaccines as important interventions to act against Plasmodium falciparum  the deadliest malaria parasite globally and the most prevalent in Africa and further supports the case for implementing the malaria vaccine as a routine child immunization., The wide-scale implementation of the malaria vaccines which began in early  holds the potential to save tens of thousands of lives each year., This is not just a scientific breakthrough but a life-saving intervention that can significantly reduce the burden of malaria on our communities., Key findings substantial public health impact  Disease surveillance during months of RTS S vaccine use and scale-up as part of the MVIP showed that malaria vaccine introduction resulted in a % vaccine-attributable reduction in all-cause mortality excluding injury among children age-eligible for vaccination compared with children living in areas where the vaccine was not in use., Substantial reductions in severe malaria and malaria hospitalizations of children were also documented., Measured impact was additional to the benefits from insecticide-treated mosquito net ITN use and access to other child health interventions and care., World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals, These findings were measured in the context of vaccine scale-up with an average third-dose coverage of about % and average fourth-dose coverage of about % across the three countries., The substantial public health impact of malaria vaccine is expected to increase as vaccine coverage increases., Figure . shows the coverage of immunization with malaria and other vaccines in the MVIP areas in the three countries from to ., Figure ., Coverage of immunization with RTS S

Other findings • Malaria vaccine uptake is high with no unintended consequences such as reduction in ITN use uptake of other childhood vaccines or change in health-seeking behaviour., • Quantitative analysis shows that parents understand that malaria vaccine reduces malaria but does not prevent all cases of malaria and continue to use other preventive and care-seeking measures ., • Community demand for and health worker acceptance of malaria vaccine is high., •, The malaria vaccine has a good safety profile – with more than  million doses provided., •, In the three pilot countries malaria vaccine even reached children who were not using other forms of malaria prevention thereby extending the programmatic reach of malaria prevention interventions., The MVIP further established that a moderately efficacious malaria vaccine can have high effectiveness and impact and will be accepted by communities and health workers., Health-related SDGs, The MVIP also provided critical information to inform the recently updated WHO recommendation for malaria vaccines that applies to both RTS S and R vaccines and forged a pathway for future malaria vaccine development., Next steps The high demand for malaria vaccines is unprecedented., More than countries have been approved for malaria vaccine introduction support by Gavi the Vaccine Alliance and wider implementation began in ., As of April  eight countries in Africa offer the malaria vaccine as part of their childhood immunization programmes Benin Burkina Faso Cameroon Ghana Kenya Liberia Malawi and Sierra Leone and up to additional countries are likely to introduce it this year., Implementing malaria vaccines in Africa represents an important step in the fight against the disease., At least countries in Africa are interested in deploying malaria vaccines as part of their national malaria control plans., Moreover the ministers of health of African countries representing the High Burden High Impact HBHI  countries in Africa met in Yaoundé Cameroon on  March  and declared their unwavering commitment to the accelerated reduction of malaria mortality and pledged to hold each other and countries accountable for the commitments outlined in the Declaration for accelerated malaria mortality reduction in Africa commitment that “No one shall die from malaria”., .., Hepatitis Globally an estimated

Thirteen of the diseases or groups of disease recognized by WHO as NTDs are targeted for eradication elimination of transmission or elimination as a public health problem and countries have eliminated at least one NTD., Bangladesh for example has recently eliminated lymphatic filariasis and visceral leishmaniasis as a public health problem Box . ., This is an encouraging sign that NTDs can be defeated by combining diverse interventions including mass and individual treatment vector control veterinary public health and provision of safe water and sanitation., The NTD roadmap – calls for a %

becomes the first country to achieve the “gold tier” status on the path to elimination of hepatitis C, In  Egypt became the first country to achieve gold tier status on the path to eliminating hepatitis C in accordance with WHO criteria., This means that Egypt has fulfilled WHO’s targets that will set the country up to achieve the reduced incidence and mortality targets of full elimination before ., Egypt has implemented one of the world’s largest nationwide public health screening and treatment programmes for hepatitis C. Egypt had one of the highest rates of viral hepatitis in the world., Between the s and s inadvertent infection transmission associated with unsafe injection practices occurred in the attempt to control schistosomiasis a parasitic disease carried by water snails., Since the early s the government has put a huge effort into strengthening hepatitis prevention with programmes covering blood safety infection control and injection safety., It also worked on raising public awareness and running harm reduction programmes., Egypt launched a network of specialized treatment centres in and with the new antiviral medicines discovered in  hepatitis testing and treatment were made accessible and free of charge for everyone., In  the government launched the presidential initiative “ million seha”  million healthy lives  a massive and unprecedented nationwide campaign to detect and treat everyone with hepatitis C escalating its elimination efforts., Through the campaign everyone over was tested later expanding to children years and older., In addition to routine testing at all health facilities the campaign used outreach in the community with teams visiting big squares markets workplaces sports clubs mosques and churches and popular meeting places such as barbershops., Vulnerable communities such as refugees and migrants and persons with disabilities were also included to leave no one behind., Between and  over  million people were tested with WHO-approved rapid diagnostic tests., Patients were also assessed and treated for other chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes., A total of ., million received treatment for hepatitis C with locally manufactured medicines between and  of which % were virally suppressed., Expanding direct public health approaches to community prevention testing and treatment as shown by Egypt’s successful public health programme to eliminate hepatitis C can have a population-wide impact., A case study concluded that five key elements contributed to Egypt’s successful programme the availability of sufficient and reliable epidemiological data a robust public health care infrastructure inclusive care that reached all sectors

Bangladesh became the first country globally to be validated for elimination of visceral leishmaniasis  also called kala azar  as a public health problem., The country achieved the elimination target of less than one case per  population at the sub-district  upazila  level in and has sustained it to date despite disruptions related to the COVID- pandemic., In  Bangladesh together with India and Nepal launched a Regional Kala-azar Elimination Initiative with the aim of wiping out the disease., The Government of Bangladesh WHO the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases TDR and several other partners supported research and development of new diagnostic tools effective treatments and vector control especially indoor residual spraying  and facilitated their roll-out and access by all those in need through donation programmes which helped the country meet the criteria set by WHO for elimination as a public health problem  ., Kala azar is the most severe form of leishmaniasis and is transmitted by sandflies it is commonly prevalent among the most disadvantaged rural communities., The disease leads to symptoms such as fever weight loss and spleen and liver enlargement and if left untreated can prove fatal in over % of cases., In  Bangladesh was also validated as the fourth country in the WHO South-East Asia Region to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem after Maldives Sri Lanka and Thailand., Lymphatic filariasis also known as elephantiasis occurs when filarial parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquito bites., The infection is usually acquired in childhood with painful and disfiguring visible manifestations appearing much later in life often in the form of enlargement of body parts causing pain severe disability and associated stigma., Lymphatic filariasis was a major public health problem in Bangladesh and was endemic in of its districts., In  the country established a national elimination programme., Between and  high-coverage mass drug administration campaigns were carried out in all endemic districts., A series of transmission assessment surveys was carried out by programme personnel between and  which demonstrated that transmission levels were below the threshold established by WHO for elimination as a public health problem., To meet WHO’s validation criteria on morbidity management and disability prevention   Bangladesh also strengthened access to the recommended essential package of care in all endemic districts., Notably over   people affected by lymphatic filariasis have been trained in self-care and provided with kits to manage their disease condition and improve their quality of life., For both kala azar and lymphatic filariasis Bangladesh will now focus on post-validation surveillance to sustain its hard-won status and prevent recurrence of infection., Source WHO   ., World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable

Of the three strains of wild poliovirus type  type and type  wild poliovirus type was eradicated in and wild poliovirus type was eradicated in ., As at  endemic wild poliovirus type remains in two countries Afghanistan and Pakistan., In  a total of cases of wild poliovirus were reported in Afghanistan and Pakistan and unlike in previous years no cases were reported from non-endemic countries  ., Although immunization coverage including polio began to recover from the impact of the COVID- pandemic during  progress is uneven., There were ., million children missing out on any vaccination –

in Staphylococcus aureus S. aureus were % and % in  respectively compared with .% and .% in ., However no conclusions can be made on whether changes in resistance have occurred over time., The reasons for this are twofold first the pool of reporting countries has changed significantly over the years., In  only countries contributed data on resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in E. coli compared with in ., Similarly only countries provided data in on methicillin resistance in S. aureus in  compared with in ., Second  the number of resource-limited settings providing data has increased in recent years., Testing coverage in these settings is often low with data often limited to tertiary referral private hospitals and or research facilities  and biased towards complex infections and treatment failures., Higher median resistance in recent years is at least in part consistent with potential biases resulting from the convenience sampling of health facilities for reporting AMR data in many settings  ., Priorities to address AMR include surveillance of antimicrobial consumption., The Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System GLASS provides a common and standardized set of methods for measuring and reporting., Of the countries with data –   % achieved the target of at least % of total antibiotic consumption being “Access” group antibiotics

Better nutrition is related to improved infant child and maternal health stronger immune systems lower risk of NCDs and longevity., Today the world faces the multiple burden of malnutrition that comprises undernutrition overweight including obesity and micronutrient deficiencies., Section . discusses the global trends in undernutrition and overweight or obesity., This section summarizes the global progress towards the reduction of anaemia among women and the consumption of trans-fatty acids TFA ., Anaemia among women Women with anaemia are more likely to experience fatigue and impaired physical capacity in their daily lives., Moderate and severe anaemia are also risk factors for adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes., Global trends in the prevalence of anaemia among all women –

target of % reduction of anaemia in women of reproductive age by  from a baseline is unlikely to be met   ., Trans-fatty acids Intake of TFA is associated with increased risk of heart attacks and death from coronary heart disease., WHO designated TFA elimination as one of its priority targets in  calling for the global elimination of industrially produced TFA by ., Mandatory TFA policies are currently in effect in  countries in all WHO regions covering % of the global population ., billion people ., Of these countries  have “best-practice” policies which include mandatory national limit

meeting on UHC political leaders reaffirmed their commitment to taking action for UHC  ., Building on the Political Declaration on UHC   the Political Declaration provides a roadmap to accelerate implementation towards achieving health for everyone everywhere and ensuring that no one is left behind., It acknowledges the importance of health systems strengthening based on a primary health care PHC approach which is critical not just for centring people and communities but also for effective health emergency prevention preparedness response and recovery which has never been more salient than during the COVID- pandemic., UHC grounded in the principle that all individuals and communities should have access to quality essential health services throughout the entire spectrum of care without enduring financial hardships not only contributes to improving health outcomes SDG  but also plays a pivotal role in other SDGs including economic growth and job creation SDG  gender equality SDG  education SDG  nutrition SDG  and poverty reduction SDG ., Strengthening health systems and enhancing the sustainability and equity of health services and financing models are pivotal factors that contribute to the successful achievement of UHC., This section delves into SDG indicators related to service delivery and health financing illustrating disparities across WHO regions and World Bank country income groups., Health-related SDGs .., Service delivery Service delivery the primary interface between health systems and people includes a wide range of health service providers but also public health-care institutions and other actors responsible for essential public health functions and provision of health-care products., Scaling up the coverage of essential health services with an emphasis  on PHC Scaling up the coverage of effective essential health services is a fundamental strategy for achieving UHC., It aims not only to improve health outcomes but also to promote health equity and ensure that health care is universally accessible and of high quality., SDG indicator .. referred to as the UHC service coverage index aims to measure the average coverage of essential services through a single index score based on indicators across four domains reproductive maternal newborn and child health RMNCH  infectious diseases NCDs and service capacity and access., This  Achieving the –– targets requires that % of people living with HIV know their HIV status % of people who know their status are receiving ART  and % of people on ART have suppressed viral loads., This translates to % of people living with HIV knowing their HIV status % of people living with HIV receiving ART  and % of people living with HIV having suppressed viral loads.score increased remarkably

target set by the Immunization Agenda is unlikely to be met for any of these vaccinations if current trends continue   ., Moreover while there has been a positive increase in the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel SDG indicator ..  rising from % in to % in and notably improving outcomes in childbirth it is important to acknowledge a slowdown in the pace of progress since  and the global target of % coverage by is unlikely to be met unless progress is accelerated   ., Positive advancements have been observed in service coverage of NCDs which continue to contribute the highest proportion of the disease burden., For example  according to the latest estimates the proportion of adults aged – years receiving treatment for hypertension increased from % in to % in ., The effective coverage for hypertension treatment is estimated to have more than doubled from % to % over the same period  ., Data on treatment coverage for alcohol and drug use disorders between and range from extremely low .% to a maximum of % for drug use disorders and % for alcohol use disorders in the countries that were able to report these data in ., To address challenges in estimating treatment coverage for substance use disorders SDG indicator ..  a service capacity index has been introduced as a complementary measure index range – ., This index varied significantly among countries with values ranging from to in ., The highest index values were observed in the European Region   while the lowest were in the African Region   .In, most settings efficiency and equity in the delivery of health services requires an increased emphasis on frontline services particularly PHC., Increasing the recruitment  development training and retention of the health workforce Health workers are the cornerstone of a resilient health system and the demand for health workers continues to increase as global health challenges become more complex and the world’s population grows and ages., To make progress towards UHC it is critical to address the global shortage of health workers so that adequate numbers of health workers are available in the right quantity in the right places in alignment with population health needs  ., Based on the latest data available over the period – for each country low-income countries had the lowest health worker density and distribution SDG

– – – reveals a consistent increase in the density and distribution of health workers across all income groups except for dentists in low-income and lower-middle-income countries and pharmacists in middle-income countries Fig. .  ., However even when national densities seem adequate  disparities persist at subnational level., Improving access to medicines and health technologies To achieve equitable access to medicines and health technologies major attention is required to this subsystem within health systems., Since  the proportion of health facilities that have a core set of relevant essential medicines available and affordable on a sustainable basis SDG indicator .b. has been estimated for only countries in the WHO Africa Region  Region of the Americas and European Region with a median value of % across the countries IQR –%   ., Work is ongoing to improve the methodology to measure access to essential medicines and other health- care products to enable sustained global

financial risks and operate efficiently and equitably., They span choices and decisions in three interlinked financing functions – mobilizing resources pooling them and using them to strategically purchase health services., Mobilizing resources and prioritizing health The Addis Ababa Action Agenda AAAA recognized that the primary mechanism for meeting resource needs for achieving the SDGs should be domestic  ., In  global government health spending the health component of SDG indicator .a., surged except in low-income countries Fig. . ., High- and upper-middle-income nations increased health priority due to COVID--related expenditures., In lower-middle-income countries slower growth in health spending compared with general government spending resulted in reduced health priority in almost half of them though outliers boosted the average., Among low-income countries half saw declining health priority as reduced government health spending coincided with higher general spending., External aid likely played a significant role in financing health-care expenses related to the COVID- pandemic in low- and lower-middle-income nations echoing a trend where higher external funding in low-income countries correlated with lower health priority in government budgets during the MDG period  .Development assistance for health DAH  to complement domestic financing As part of the AAAA countries committed to reverse the decline in aid to the poorest and fragile countries  many of which will require sustained DAH to address capacity constraints and continue progress toward UHC., However DAH must add to domestic resources rather than crowding them out and support efforts to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of domestic resources utilization., In  the African Region received the highest weighted average health ODA per capita US$ ., compared with countries in other regions less than US$  per capita  SDG indicator .b.  ., While DAH has undeniably contributed to noteworthy health improvements the current architecture and incentives associated with such assistance have inadvertently led many nations to neglect funding for basic health services in their own budgets and become overly aid-dependent  ., The COVID- pandemic has shown the perils of overdependence on external sources of finance and distant suppliers for critical health needs  ., Improve

Sustainable Development Goals   Progress towards WHO Triple Billion targets The WHO Triple Billion targets outlined in and as the foundation of the WHO GPW are a set of ambitious goals aimed at improving global health by  one billion more people benefitting from UHC one billion more people better protected from health emergencies and one billion more people enjoying better health and well-being   ., Functioning as both an impact measurement tool and a policy strategy they are an integral part of the GPW Results Framework., The targets focus on achieving measurable impacts on people’s health at the country regional and global levels., They are tangible related to human lives and able to drive changes., Triple Billion targets are based on outcome indicators to track the progress that WHO and its Member States achieve in improving population health at the country level., The indicators include SDG indicators and seven non-SDG indicators approved by WHO Member States to address country priorities during the nd World Health Assembly WHA  in   ., The close alignment between the Triple Billion and SDGs enables countries to apply Triple Billion targets in delivering their commitments on the SDGs., Triple Billion projections were calculated for the years – relative to a baseline providing much- needed milestones for progress made at the global  regional and country levels in providing promoting and protecting global health., This chapter focuses on the global and regional results to date  ., Overall the world has collectively achieved the healthier population billion target but is lagging on the other two billions., Relative to  there was an estimated ., billion UI .–. billion more people enjoying better health and well-being in  this will likely rise to more than ., billion UI .–. billion by ., In contrast there was only ., billion UI .–. billion  more people in benefitting from UHC and only ., billion .–. billion better protected from health emergencies., These figures will likely rise to ., billion  .–. billion and . billion UI .–. billion by  respectively – far below the target of one billion  ., The overall contribution of the UHC billion was disaggregated and the contribution of each underlying tracer indicator calculated allowing for precise assessment of the impact of these individual indicators  . ., Healthier populations billion The healthier populations HPOP billion aims to improve population health and well-being by promoting healthier behaviours lifestyles and environments., Achieving this billion relies on multisectoral intervention through advocacy and changes in public policy and regulation., The calculation of this billion comprised tracer indicators including four disaggregated indicators that cover a wide range of health topics including clean air safe water road safety tobacco and alcohol consumption obesity violence child nutrition and development., Overall the world has been progressing steadily towards the HPOP billion target since ., This target was achieved in with ., billion UI .–. billion more people enjoying better health and well-being compared with ., Although this trend was not reversed progress slowed considerably during the – COVID- pandemic., The year-to-year change of HPOP contribution was  million from to  but was only  million from to  followed by

without inflicting financial hardship., The calculation of progress towards the UHC billion relied on the assessment of two components   average service coverage measured through tracer indicators and   financial hardship measured through an indicator of catastrophic health spending defined as the proportion of population whose household expenditure on health is greater than % of total household expenditure or income., By  there were only  million more people benefitting from UHC without incurring catastrophic health spending compared with  not even reaching half of the UHC billion target., The projection for  is a mere  million suggesting that the world is seriously off the mark in achieving the UHC billion target., The impact of COVID- pandemic was salient as the UHC billion reduced or

indicators., The projected Triple Billion progress since  the first year of the GPW showed that significant progress has been achieved for all three of the billions particularly the HPOP billion as the world has likely already achieved the target of having one billion more people living healthier lives by  Fig. . ., However such progress is far from sufficient to ensure the health-related SDG

projections orange lines progress required to reach the  SDG targets., Source WHO  ., The world needs to intensify efforts to achieve the health- related SDG targets by  which is vital for building healthier more equitable and prosperous societies globally., For such efforts timely and accurate monitoring of the progress based on robust data is vital for effective policy changes and interventions., However lack of timely reporting and delay in producing health estimates using the most recent empirical data could bring great challenges in delivering accurate assessment for many health outcomes., Figure . shows the percentage of UHC service coverage index tracers for which primary data were available for years –., It is evident that most indicators suffered from a data shortage at various degrees across countries., A lot could be done to enhance the data input for the Triple Billion computation., More often than not the lack of data will not be limited to the data required by the Triple Billion rather it is deeply entrenched in poorly performing health information systems., Thus efforts should be made to strengthen the general health information systems in countries to generate reliable data for the effective tracking of and policy changes regarding health-related SDGs., WHO is committed to work with Member States to strengthen their system capacity to collect analyse and use health data., Various tools have been developed by WHO to enhance countries’ data capacity., For example  the WHO SCORE for health data technical package was designed to assess the performance of national health information systems identify the data gaps and provide a toolbox to improve various areas of a functioning health information system  ., The Data management competency framework DMCF developed by the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific is another example of such a tool it enables health information managers to identify capacity gaps and drive competency development at various levels Box . ., World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals Figure ., Percentage of UHC service coverage index tracers for which primary data were available for years  – Source  WHO and World Bank  ., Box ., Strategic and integrated capacity-building of the health information workforce in the Western Pacific Region Strategic use of data for decision-making is critical for measuring and driving progress towards global and national health indicator targets., Capacity limitations of health information workers HIW often hinder the ability to effectively produce and use health data despite significant improvements in health information systems., HIWs often do not possess the required capacities to participate consistently and in a timely manner in the data management cycle., To systematically assess such capacity gaps the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific with support from WHO headquarters country offices and in collaboration with partner organizations launched the DMCF in May   ., This framework is a comprehensive integrated and coherent tool that can be used to define and assess current and future competency needs of HIWs across the region and beyond., This tool will enable health information managers in countries to identify capacity gaps and plan and drive the competency development of their HIWs across different levels of their health system., Papua New Guinea has set out a clear path as the first country to adopt the framework., As a direct outcome of a national health information workshop held in October  Papua New Guinea National Department of Health collaborated with WHO to establish a standardized set of competencies required for health information positions at both national and provincial levels based on the ideally required skills and competencies spelled out in the WHO DMCF., These competency profiles are invaluable as they provide a clear foundation for developing tools to assess training needs and formulating comprehensive long-term capacity-building strategies., The national data management competency profiles were officially launched together with the Provincial Health Authority Monitoring & Evaluation toolkit in September ., China followed suit by identifying the framework’s value in improving health information workforce capacity in a systematic and sustainable manner., The Center for Health Statistics and Information of the National Health Commission of China collaborated with WHO in translating the framework into Chinese and conducted a series of workshops at both national and provincial levels in preparation for conducting competency gap assessments among different types of health workers across different provinces., The adoption of the framework in Papua New Guinea and China serves as pivotal examples highlighting how the WHO DMCF could be applied to each Member State’s unique context., This ability to contextualize and apply the framework is essential given the diverse nature of Member States’ health information systems and their diverse priorities and needs in addressing both present and future health challenges., Progress towards WHO Triple Billion targets ., Conclusion The WHO Triple Billion is a framework and a strategy aiming to drive timely improvement of global health., The targets although set at the global level were simply the aggregation of country-level estimates that were calculated based on underlying tracer indicators., The Triple Billion projections provide WHO its Member States and partners with the much-needed assessment of progress towards fulfilling their commitment on Triple Billion targets and the health-related SDGs., Tracer indicators are the cornerstone of the Triple Billion targets but also a critical tool for countries to identify and prioritize strategies to enhance the health of their populations., By examining the projected contributions at indicator level policy-makers can make informed course adjustments to achieve the SDGs set by the global community., As the GPW is drawing to a close in  continuous tracking of the Triple Billion targets and a proper transition from GPW to GPW is vital for WHO to ensure accountability adaptability and efficiency in achieving the ambitious goals it set jointly with its Member States., All three levels of WHO – headquarters regional and country offices – should make every effort to align their priorities., Through these priorities that will be reflected in the new programmatic and outcome indicators for the upcoming GPW WHO will reaffirm its commitment to address evolving global health needs enhance collaboration with stakeholders and strengthen its role in advancing global health equity and security., Committed investment in improving data and health information systems across the globe will be essential for such endeavours., References ., Thirteenth

global health, The global population and economic growth the advancement of science and technology and the ever- increasing interconnectedness of the world have brought about enormous societal changes along with unprecedented progress but also multiple and complex challenges affecting the health of billions of people worldwide., This chapter looks at selected key global health issues such as the double burden of malnutrition where undernutrition coexists in parallel with overweight and obesity globally., It also highlights the health challenges faced by persons with disabilities and refugees and international migrants.., The double burden of malnutrition Combating malnutrition in all its forms is one of the greatest global health challenges., Today the world faces the double burden of malnutrition characterized by the coexistence of undernutrition along with overweight and obesity within individuals households and populations  and across the life course., This section highlights the global and regional trends in the population-level burden of stunting wasting and overweight among children under  years of age and the double burden of thinness or underweight and obesity among older children adolescents and adults., Box . summarizes the definitions of the indicators of malnutrition used in this section., Child stunting stems from poor nutrition during pregnancy and early childhood., It can lead to severe physical and cognitive damage that may last a lifetime., A child who is moderately or severely wasted due to recent rapid weight loss or a failure to gain weight has an increased risk of death., In contrast a child may be overweight due to excessive caloric intake which may be due to poor access to nutritious foods consumption of nutrient-poor ultra-processed foods and or inadequate physical activity., In childhood and adolescence obesity is associated with greater risks and earlier onset of various NCDs such as type diabetes and cardiovascular disease., In addition children and teenagers living with obesity may experience psychosocial consequences from stigma discrimination and bullying., Undernutrition as measured by thinness among children aged – years lowers learning potential weakens the immune system and increases the risk of morbidity and mortality., Micronutrient deficiencies and anaemia in adolescent girls amplify the risk of life-threatening complications during pregnancy and childbirth., In adults obesity is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality from a variety of NCDs such as cardiovascular diseases diabetes cancers neurological disorders chronic respiratory diseases and digestive disorders., Undernutrition in adults as captured by the underweight indicator is critical for adult women during pregnancy with repercussions for both mother and child., In older adults undernutrition can lead to increased risk of impaired immune response and physical and cognitive impairment., In turn ageing brings physiological changes with sensory impairment poor oral health isolation loneliness and depression which further exacerbate the risk of undernutrition., Box ., Definitions of metrics and measures used in this section For children under  years of age • Stunting height-for-age lower than standard deviations below WHO Child Growth Standards median • Wasting weight-for-height lower than standard deviations below WHO Child Growth Standards median •, Overweight weight-for-height greater than standard deviations above WHO Child Growth Standards median., For children and adolescents aged – years •, Thinness BMI-for-age lower than standard deviations below the WHO Growth Reference median • Obesity BMI-for-age greater than standard deviations above the WHO Growth Reference median., For adults aged years and older • Underweight BMI less than ., • Obesity BMI greater than or equal to ., BMI body mass index calculated as weight kg  height² m² ., Crude prevalence is used for children and adolescents aged – years and age-standardized prevalence is used for adults aged years and older., World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals .., The magnitude of the problem In  an estimated  million UI – million  children under  years of age globally were affected by stunting too short for age and  million UI – million were affected by wasting too thin for height  revealing the vast extent of undernutrition among the youngest population., However an estimated  million  UI – million children under  years of age were overweight in  ., In the same year among older children and adolescents aged – years an estimated  million UI – million were living with thinness while  million  UI – million were living with obesity., Among adults aged years and older an estimated  million were underweight while  million were living with obesity., This means that over one billion people aged  years and older worldwide are living with obesity while over half a billion others are living with underweight or thinness  ., These numbers along with the health implications described above indicate that the world is dealing with a public health problem not only at a massive scale but also a complex one..., Stunting wasting and overweight among children under  years of age Undernutrition among children under  years of age globally as reflected by the number affected by stunting and wasting has declined in the past three decades., The number affected by stunting declined from  million UI – million in to  million  UI – million in ., Over the same period the number affected by wasting declined from  million  UI – million to  million UI – million  and the number of overweight rose from  million UI  – million to  million UI – million  ., The global prevalence of stunting SDG indicator .. almost halved from .% UI .–.%, in to .%, UI .–.%, in  and the prevalence of wasting SDG indicator .. declined by % from .%, UI .–.%, to .%, UI .–.% ., However the prevalence of overweight SDG indicator .. increased by % from .%, UI .–.%, to .%, UI .–.%  , during the same period Fig. .  ., Figure ., Prevalence of stunting wasting and overweight among

age affected by stunting from the  baseline and to reduce the prevalence of wasting and overweight to less than %   ., Almost all WHO regions are experiencing a considerable burden of both undernutrition in the form of stunting and wasting and overweight among the youngest population., In the South-East Asia Region the prevalence of overweight nearly doubled in the past three decades  reaching .%, UI .–.%, in  while the prevalence of wasting continued to be the highest across all WHO regions despite having declined from .% UI .–.%, in to .%, UI .–.%, in ., This means that in almost one in five .% children in this region were either too thin or too heavy for their height., In addition three out of  .%, UI .–.%, children were affected by stunting even though its prevalence had

tackle the double burden of malnutrition, The coexistence of undernutrition overweight and obesity can be addressed by taking advantage of the shared drivers across forms of malnutrition including biological environmental and social factors to design and implement policies and programmes using a life- course multi-generational approach., These double- duty actions are evidence-based efficient and effective interventions that can make the most of often limited time fiscal and human resources., Common delivery platforms that can be leveraged for double-duty actions include national dietary guidelines health systems urban food systems humanitarian settings and social policies – ., Double-duty actions need not necessarily be new actions., Rather policy-makers can capitalize on existing government buy-in and resources by reviewing and refocusing existing food and agriculture policies., They often already exist to address single forms of malnutrition but need to be refocused to address multiple forms simultaneously., Strong opportunities for double-duty actions include the following examples school feeding programmes that focus only on addressing undernutrition or overweight can be redesigned to ensure that they instead provide and promote a healthy diet scaling up the WHO antenatal care recommendations protecting and promoting breastfeeding revising complementary feeding guidelines and educating care-givers on the risks of unhealthy complementary foods designing social support and welfare programmes to reduce risks from unhealthy foods and ensuring that food systems and food environment policies facilitate the purchase and consumption of a healthy diet by increasing access to and attractiveness of nutritious foods., Nutrition and food safety are closely interlinked and essential for achieving positive health outcomes from food systems., There is a linkage between subclinical infection with enteropathogens and stunting   ., Food must be safe available accessible nutritious  culturally acceptable and ingested regularly to ensure growth health and well-being., Unsafe food increases infection and intoxication creating a vicious cycle of disease malnutrition and disability particularly affecting vulnerable groups. ., Disability-related health inequities Disability results from the interaction between health conditions and or impairments that a person experiences such as dementia blindness or spinal cord injury and a range of contextual factors related to different environmental and personal factors including societal attitudes access to infrastructure discriminatory policies  poverty age and gender., This understanding of disability is grounded in the WHO International classification of functioning disability and health ICF  published in  ., According to the WHO Global report on health equity for persons with disabilities  approximately . billion persons in – about % of the global population – had disability., The global number of persons with disabilities has increased substantially in the past decade due to demographic and epidemiological changes such as population growth and the increase in the number of persons with NCDs who are living longer and ageing with limitations in functioning  ., Persons with disabilities often experience health inequities due to avoidable unjust and unfair conditions., They die younger have poorer health and increased disease risk and more limitations in their everyday functioning., The contributing factors to these inequities can be i health-system-related factors such as barriers in physical infrastructure and communication negative attitudes by health workers or lack of disability data in the health information system  ii structural factors such as stigma and discrimination  iii social determinants such as poverty and lack of education and iv disease risk factors such as tobacco consumption and obesity., World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals .., Premature mortality among persons with disabilities Data on health inequities in terms of premature mortality among persons with disabilities are scarce., However a growing body of evidence indicates that persons with disabilities have higher rates of premature mortality compared with persons without disabilities  ., A systematic review of studies from low- and middle- income countries found that persons with disabilities have double the mortality rates of persons without disabilities  ., Premature mortality is even more visible in those that are most marginalized among persons with disabilities., For example evidence from some high-income European countries shows that persons with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities have higher risks of premature mortality compared with the general population – ., The COVID- pandemic exacerbated this pattern., A systematic review of studies found that persons with disabilities were almost three times as likely to die from COVID- than persons without disabilities  ..., Poorer health and higher disease risk among persons with disabilities Persons with disabilities have in general poorer health and higher risk of developing secondary health conditions  ., Data from across European countries collected via the European Health Interview Survey in show that overall compared with persons without disability persons with severe disability are more likely to report having NCDs including chronic respiratory diseases over eight times as likely  coronary heart disease or angina pectoris  times as

of data from the European Health Interview Survey  ., Key issues and trends in global health .., Contributing factors to health inequities among persons with disabilities There is a range of contributing factors within and beyond the health system that drive premature mortality and increased morbidity among persons with disabilities., In terms of health-system factors lack of accessible and inclusive health service provision often leaves persons with disabilities behind., A systematic review of  studies from eight high-income countries found that women with disabilities are % less likely to have been screened for breast cancer and % less likely to have been screened for cervical cancer than their non-disabled peers  ., Data from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in countries show that children with disabilities are generally at greater risk of missing out on vaccinations  only % of children aged – months with more  than one functional difficulty are fully vaccinated compared with % of children at the same age without disabilities  ., Evidence from countries shows that persons with disabilities have lower access to health services than those without disabilities Fig. . ., Across these countries the median estimate shows that persons with disabilities are more than four times as likely as persons without disabilities to be unable to get health care when they need it % of persons with disabilities versus % of persons without disabilities indicated that they needed but could not get health care., In eight countries more than % of persons with disabilities were not able to get health care when they needed it   ., In European countries costs of services geographical location and long waiting lists which disproportionately affect persons with disabilities are major factors in the lower access to health services., Beyond health-system factors persons with disabilities are also more likely to have risk factors for ill health., Data from European countries show that compared with persons without disabilities persons with severe disabilities are overall three times as likely to self-report having high blood pressure twice as likely to be obese and a third as likely to do regular aerobic physical activity Fig. .  ., Very often the reason for the higher risk factor presence in persons with disabilities is the lack of accessible health promotion and prevention strategies which do not allow this population to benefit equally  ., Different social determinants also play an important role as factors that drive health inequities among persons with disabilities., Poverty is a solid example to demonstrate this., Poor living conditions and social exclusion add to the risk of poor health and unmet health-care needs among persons with disabilities., Across European countries .% of persons with severe disabilities were at risk of poverty before social transfers  such as benefits allowances and pensions  compared with .% of persons with no disability., Yet even after social transfers poverty risk is still double among persons with disabilities .%, compared with .%  Fig. . ., In nine countries there was little or no

World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals Poverty affects the state of health of persons with disabilities – through inability to afford health-related expenses overcrowded and poor living conditions that contribute to the spread of diseases poor mental health and social exclusion among other factors., According to the analysis from European countries persons with severe disability are overall twice as likely to report having unmet health-care needs due to financial limitations than persons with no disability., They are also almost twice as likely to be unable to meet unexpected financial expenses e.g. having surgery or repairing their house  more likely to be overburdened by housing costs and four times as likely to be living in

Statistics on Income and Living Conditions –    ., Key issues and trends in global health Box ., Intimate partner violence against women with disabilities A systematic review of studies mainly from high-income countries concluded that the prevalence of all forms of IPV including physical psychological emotional sexual and financial was higher among women with disabilities than among women without disabilities  ., Evidence is also emerging from low- and middle-income countries., For example analysis of data from seven violence-prevention programmes in low- and middle-income countries indicated that women with disabilities were nearly twice as likely to report past--month IPV than women without disabilities  ., Current estimates are likely significant underestimates as women with disabilities tend to be underrepresented in surveys and may also experience disability-specific types of violence that are often unmeasured., For a better understanding of the risk factors for violence against women and to enable the development of more specialized prevention strategies and response plans it is necessary to improve the inclusion of women with disabilities and the issue of disability within violence against women in population-based surveys and research., WHO recently issued recommendations for good practice in measuring violence against women with disabilities  . .., Towards disability- inclusive and data- informed health systems, The way forward to achieve inclusive health systems and leave no one behind includes a systems-level response through strengthening health systems that integrates targeted actions to advance health equity for persons with disabilities., It is essential that the actions that governments take to advance disability inclusion in the health sector are informed by valid and reliable data that allow monitoring and tracking progress., As shown above however data on health inequities among persons with disabilities are scarce., Factors contributing to the inequity are frequently not well captured making it difficult sometimes to explore the drivers of the differences and whether these differences are indeed due to unjust or unfair factors., The collection of data on disability is often deprioritized in many countries consequently the evidence of health inequities and their contributing factors is more limited than for other groups in marginalized situations., However lack of evidence should not be interpreted as a lack of inequities., There is a fundamental need to collect or disaggregate population- and facility-based data based on disability status across the different levels of country health information systems., For example at input level administrative sources such as financial tracking systems databases and records on human resources infrastructure or policies can be used to understand how financing for disability works or whether health facilities are accessible., At output level facility assessments or facility reporting systems can measure availability of services service readiness or quality., At outcome and impact level disability-specific surveys or routine health and demographic surveys that allow disaggregation of data by disability and integrating disability indicators in facility-level data collection can facilitate in-depth understanding of the experiences of persons with disabilities in terms of health-care needs and coverage., Chile is among the countries that have implemented the WHO Model Disability Survey to inform policy Box . ., Only through valid and reliable data on disability will countries be able to develop evidenced-based policies to monitor the SDGs to measure progress towards national targets such as UHC and to take stock of the challenges that remain., World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals Box ., The role of data in improving the lives of persons with disability in Chile The Model Disability Survey MDS  developed by WHO and the World Bank in  addresses the scarcity of data and often poor quality of information on persons with disabilities in many countries  ., The survey takes a broader approach to disability collecting data on functioning and environmental barriers and facilitators., WHO has been supporting the successful implementation of the MDS in more than countries to date providing a comprehensive assessment of the situation of persons with disabilities and contributing to better public policy., Under the leadership of the Ministry of Social Development and Family and the National Disability Service  SENADIS  with participation from the Ministry of Health the WHO MDS was implemented in Chile for the first time in   ., Preparation of the survey took more than a year including consultation with persons with disabilities civil society groups their families and supporters across all regions of the country., The survey found that one in six .% people aged  years and older in Chile had disabilities in  .% of adults and .% of children aged – years ., An estimated % of adults with disability had a mental or behavioural disorder., It also identified barriers that persons with disability experienced including in health and transport  ., The findings informed the development of key legislation plans and actions to address the identified barriers., For example Law ., on labour inclusion was implemented setting a labour quota of % for workers with disabilities that all companies with more than workers must meet – with plans dedicated to gradually increase this percentage., Furthermore the results of the study helped design protocols and methodologies to improve the level of participation of persons with disabilities such as the national census that incorporated a protocol to interview persons with disabilities in their homes., In addition the development of the National Mental Health Action Plan which was launched in  and the National Disability Qualification and Certification Plan., More actions were taken towards improving access to health services among persons with disabilities., In addition a decision was taken to include disability questions in the country’s National Health Survey to enable the government to better track progress and understand unmet service needs among persons with disabilities., In line with the WHO recommendation to undertake the MDS every – years to track progress on the situations of persons with disabilities and dependency Chile implemented the survey for a second time in   ., The results of the new assessment will help the Government of Chile better understand the impact of disability-related policies and actions that the country has taken and plan next steps towards addressing the needs of persons with disabilities and to monitor the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. ., Health of refugees and migrants The number of international migrants increased from  million .% of the global population in  to  million .% of the global population in   ., This number does not include internal migrants  which were estimated to be around  million in   ., In addition in mid- an estimated  million people were forcibly displaced including those who are internally displaced refugees and asylum seekers  ., Migration could either improve or degrade an individual’s health status., Refugees and migrants often face worse health outcomes in countries of transit and destination due to barriers such as language and cultural differences institutional discrimination and restricted use of health services., The first WHO World report on the health of refugees and migrants released in  offers an overview of the health of refugees and international migrants along with the associated determinants and public health challenges while also revealing crucial gaps in global data and knowledge  ., Prioritizing the rights of refugees and migrants to timely affordable and dignified health care is essential for achieving health equity., Key issues and trends in global health .., Key issues affecting the health of refugees and migrants Some flows of global migration can be predicted by factors such as economic growth and demographic changes., However displacements due to emergencies arising from disease outbreaks conflicts natural disasters and climate change pose significant challenges., Health and social protection systems need to be prepared for sudden upheaval of populations., New and renewed emergencies are straining health services in all WHO regions., In addition to deaths and injuries the risks of infectious diseases and mental health conditions also increase meanwhile health facilities may be unable to cope as they are heavily affected by power and supply outages or even targeted in conflicts., The threat of malnutrition and starvation exists further down the line as a result of disrupted food supplies  exacerbating critical health needs of already vulnerable populations  ., Although a large proportion of refugees and migrants are in generally good health their numbers also include children elderly people persons with disabilities and those whose health has been negatively impacted by their travels or the circumstances in their home country., Some might start a family get sick or get injured in their host country., These health needs transcend national boundaries but many countries restrict health coverage based on immigration status limiting access to health insurance and services and the cost of non-emergency care may be an unaffordable out-of-pocket expense., These factors leave millions in vulnerable situations globally and they may encounter poorer health outcomes particularly in substandard living and working conditions  ., For instance studies have found higher rates of anaemia in women and children among refugees and migrants compared with local populations and there is an increased risk of both anaemia and malnutrition in some camp-based settings – ., Migrant workers may face discrimination exploitation limited workplace rights and social protection as well as significant occupational health problems such as higher risk of occupational injuries documented particularly among male migrant workers employed in high-risk industries – ., During the COVID- pandemic migrant workers in some countries particularly those in low-skilled roles faced heightened exposure risks due to overcrowded living conditions – ., Those who were employed in essential sectors such as health care and agriculture bore a disproportionate burden of pandemic-related challenges  – ., In addition refugees and migrants may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of AMR during various phases of migration and displacement due to factors such as exposure to infections limited access to diagnostics and therapeutics and inappropriate use of antibiotics  ., Figure .,

mixed patterns of NCD burden and risks among migrants and refugees compared with host populations., Taking cancer as an example studies from three high-income countries in the Americas suggested better outcomes for migrants with cancer  whereas research from two high-income European countries indicated that cancer was often diagnosed at advanced stages among refugee and migrant populations leading to poorer health outcomes than host populations – ., Studies from three African countries underscored gaps in cervical cancer awareness among refugee and migrant women stressing the importance of prevention and early detection interventions – ., These challenges are mirrored in other regions with refugee and migrant women facing barriers to HPV vaccination in settings where factors such as clinic accessibility and physician recommendations play significant roles   ., Box ., presents an analysis on migration-related health inequalities based on data from  European countries., Box .,

Income and Living Conditions –    ., Patterns of inequality in NCD burden and risk factors between migrants and non-migrants varied greatly across European countries reflecting the multifaceted influence of genetic social environmental and other factors that contribute to NCD burden Fig. . ., For example the proportion of people reporting a long-standing illness or health problem is more than  percentage points higher among migrants compared with non-migrants in seven countries but is more than  percentage points higher among non-migrants in six other countries., Reported high blood pressure prevalence is more than  percentage points higher among migrant populations in three countries but is more than  percentage points higher among non-migrant populations in seven other countries   .Similarly inequalities in the prevalence of NCD risk factors varied across countries., For example the prevalence of tobacco smoking was over  percentage points higher among migrants in four countries but over  percentage points higher among non-migrants in six countries., In eight countries reported overweight prevalence was at least  percentage points higher among migrant populations  while it was also at least  percentage points higher among non-migrant populations in eight countries   ., Therefore inequalities in NCDs between migrants and non-migrants vary significantly across European countries  underscoring the imperative for tailored country-specific investigations into health inequalities and their drivers to inform equity-oriented policies and programmes., World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals .., The need for quality data on refugee and migrant health There is a lack of timely representative and systematically collected disaggregated data on refugee and migrant health in national health information systems., This makes it challenging to understand and address their health needs develop

of causes of deaths Not only has the pandemic set back healthy longevity worldwide by years it also reversed the previous trends of shifting disease burden to NCDs., Grouping deaths into three broad categories of causes of death – communicable maternal perinatal and nutritional conditions “communicable diseases” hereafter  NCDs  and injuries – clear transition can be noticed well before the

Children under the age of five are particularly vulnerable in  almost four in every five malaria deaths in the region were among these young children  ., WHO recently added the programmatic use of malaria vaccines for children living in endemic areas to the malaria prevention toolbox., The first malaria vaccine RTS S AS RTS S  was recommended by WHO in after successful pilot programmes in Ghana Kenya and Malawi through the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme Box . ., In  WHO recommended a second safe and effective malaria vaccine R-Matrix-M R  ., Wide implementation of malaria vaccines is expected to save tens of thousands of lives each year., Malaria vaccine implementation in Ghana Kenya and Malawi, The Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme MVIP was established by WHO to evaluate the public health use of the first malaria vaccine RTS S AS  ., Findings from the pilot programme informed the historic WHO recommendation in October for a vaccine to prevent malaria in children., Through the collaborative effort with the ministries of health in Ghana Kenya and Malawi from to  the RTS S malaria vaccine was integrated into routine child immunization services as part of each country’s national malaria control programme., Over million children received the RTS S malaria vaccine through the pilot., Findings from MVIP show that the RTS S vaccine substantially reduces early childhood deaths and hospitalizations for severe malaria., In October  WHO recommended a second safe and effective malaria vaccine R for routine use., This recommendation resulting in sufficient vaccine supply to scale up malaria vaccines broadly coupled with the high impact seen with the introduction of the RTS S vaccine underscores the potential of malaria vaccines as important interventions to act against Plasmodium falciparum  the deadliest malaria parasite globally and the most prevalent in Africa and further supports the case for implementing the malaria vaccine as a routine child immunization., The wide-scale implementation of the malaria vaccines which began in early  holds the potential to save tens of thousands of lives each year., This is not just a scientific breakthrough but a life-saving intervention that can significantly reduce the burden of malaria on our communities., Key findings substantial public health impact  Disease surveillance during months of RTS S vaccine use and scale-up as part of the MVIP showed that malaria vaccine introduction resulted in a % vaccine-attributable reduction in all-cause mortality excluding injury among children age-eligible for vaccination compared with children living in areas where the vaccine was not in use., Substantial reductions in severe malaria and malaria hospitalizations of children were also documented., Measured impact was additional to the benefits from insecticide-treated mosquito net ITN use and access to other child health interventions and care., World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals, These findings were measured in the context of vaccine scale-up with an average third-dose coverage of about % and average fourth-dose coverage of about % across the three countries., The substantial public health impact of malaria vaccine is expected to increase as vaccine coverage increases., Figure . shows the coverage of

unintended consequences such as reduction in ITN use uptake of other childhood vaccines or change in health-seeking behaviour., • Quantitative analysis shows that parents understand that malaria vaccine reduces malaria but does not prevent all cases of malaria and continue to use other preventive and care-seeking measures ., • Community demand for and health worker acceptance of malaria vaccine is high., The malaria vaccine has a good safety profile – with more than  million doses provided., In the three pilot countries malaria vaccine even reached children who were not using other forms of malaria prevention thereby extending the programmatic reach of malaria prevention interventions., The MVIP further established that a moderately efficacious malaria vaccine can have high effectiveness and impact and will be accepted by communities and health workers., Health-related SDGs, The MVIP also provided critical information to inform the recently updated WHO recommendation for malaria vaccines that applies to both RTS S and R vaccines and forged a pathway for future malaria vaccine development., Next steps The high demand for malaria vaccines is unprecedented., More than countries have been approved for malaria vaccine introduction support by Gavi the Vaccine Alliance and wider implementation began in ., As of April  eight countries in Africa offer the malaria vaccine as part of their childhood immunization programmes Benin Burkina Faso Cameroon Ghana Kenya Liberia Malawi and Sierra Leone and up to additional countries are likely to introduce it this year., Implementing malaria vaccines in Africa represents an important step in the fight against the disease., At least countries in Africa are interested in deploying malaria vaccines as part of their national malaria control plans., Moreover the ministers of health of African countries representing the High Burden High Impact HBHI  countries in Africa met in Yaoundé Cameroon on  March  and declared their unwavering commitment to the accelerated reduction of malaria mortality and pledged to hold each other and countries accountable for the commitments outlined in the Declaration for accelerated malaria mortality reduction in Africa commitment that “No one shall die from malaria”., Hepatitis Globally an estimated  million people were living with chronic hepatitis B and C in  of

status on the path to elimination of hepatitis C, In  Egypt became the first country to achieve gold tier status on the path to eliminating hepatitis C in accordance with WHO criteria., This means that Egypt has fulfilled WHO’s targets that will set the country up to achieve the reduced incidence and mortality targets of full elimination before ., Egypt has implemented one of the world’s largest nationwide public health screening and treatment programmes for hepatitis C. Egypt had one of the highest rates of viral hepatitis in the world., Between the s and s inadvertent infection transmission associated with unsafe injection practices occurred in the attempt to control schistosomiasis a parasitic disease carried by water snails., Since the early s the government has put a huge effort into strengthening hepatitis prevention with programmes covering blood safety infection control and injection safety., It also worked on raising public awareness and running harm reduction programmes., Egypt launched a network of specialized treatment centres in and with the new antiviral medicines discovered in  hepatitis testing and treatment were made accessible and free of charge for everyone., In  the government launched the presidential initiative “ million seha”  million healthy lives  a massive and unprecedented nationwide campaign to detect and treat everyone with hepatitis C escalating its elimination efforts., Through the campaign everyone over was tested later expanding to children years and older., In addition to routine testing at all health facilities the campaign used outreach in the community with teams visiting big squares markets workplaces sports clubs mosques and churches and popular meeting places such as barbershops., Vulnerable communities such as refugees and migrants and persons with disabilities were also included to leave no one behind., Between and  over  million people were tested with WHO-approved rapid diagnostic tests., Patients were also assessed and treated for other chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes., A total of ., million received treatment for hepatitis C with locally manufactured medicines between and  of which % were virally suppressed., Expanding direct public health approaches to community prevention testing and treatment as shown by Egypt’s successful public health programme to eliminate hepatitis C can have a population-wide impact., A case study concluded that five key elements contributed to Egypt’s successful programme the availability of sufficient and reliable epidemiological data a robust public health care infrastructure inclusive care that reached all sectors

globally to be validated for elimination of visceral leishmaniasis  also called kala azar  as a public health problem., The country achieved the elimination target of less than one case per  population at the sub-district  upazila  level in and has sustained it to date despite disruptions related to the COVID- pandemic., In  Bangladesh together with India and Nepal launched a Regional Kala-azar Elimination Initiative with the aim of wiping out the disease., The Government of Bangladesh WHO the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases TDR and several other partners supported research and development of new diagnostic tools effective treatments and vector control especially indoor residual spraying  and facilitated their roll-out and access by all those in need through donation programmes which helped the country meet the criteria set by WHO for elimination as a public health problem  ., Kala azar is the most severe form of leishmaniasis and is transmitted by sandflies it is commonly prevalent among the most disadvantaged rural communities., The disease leads to symptoms such as fever weight loss and spleen and liver enlargement and if left untreated can prove fatal in over % of cases., In  Bangladesh was also validated as the fourth country in the WHO South-East Asia Region to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem after Maldives Sri Lanka and Thailand., Lymphatic filariasis also known as elephantiasis occurs when filarial parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquito bites., The infection is usually acquired in childhood with painful and disfiguring visible manifestations appearing much later in life often in the form of enlargement of body parts causing pain severe disability and associated stigma., Lymphatic filariasis was a major public health problem in Bangladesh and was endemic in of its districts., In  the country established a national elimination programme., Between and  high-coverage mass drug administration campaigns were carried out in all endemic districts., A series of transmission assessment surveys was carried out by programme personnel between and  which demonstrated that transmission levels were below the threshold established by WHO for elimination as a public health problem., To meet WHO’s validation criteria on morbidity management and disability prevention   Bangladesh also strengthened access to the recommended essential package of care in all endemic districts., Notably over   people affected by lymphatic filariasis have been trained in self-care and provided with kits to manage their disease condition and improve their quality of life., For both kala azar and lymphatic filariasis Bangladesh will now focus on post-validation surveillance to sustain its hard-won status and prevent recurrence of infection., Source WHO   ., World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals .., Polio

countries provided data in on methicillin resistance in S. aureus in  compared with in ., Second  the number of resource-limited settings providing data has increased in recent years., Testing coverage in these settings is often low with data often limited to tertiary referral private hospitals and or research facilities  and biased towards complex infections and treatment failures., Higher median resistance in recent years is at least in part consistent with potential biases resulting from the convenience sampling of health facilities for reporting AMR data in many settings  ., Priorities to address AMR include surveillance of antimicrobial consumption., The Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System GLASS provides a common and standardized set of methods

Triple Billion targets The WHO Triple Billion targets outlined in and as the foundation of the WHO GPW are a set of ambitious goals aimed at improving global health by  one billion more people benefitting from UHC one billion more people better protected from health emergencies and one billion more people enjoying better health and well-being   ., Functioning as both an impact measurement tool and a policy strategy they are an integral part of the GPW Results Framework., The targets focus on achieving measurable impacts on people’s health at the country regional and global levels., They are tangible related to human lives and able to drive changes., Triple Billion targets are based on outcome indicators to track the progress that WHO and its Member States achieve in improving population health at the country level., The indicators include SDG indicators and seven non-SDG indicators approved by WHO Member States to address country priorities during the nd World Health Assembly WHA  in   ., The close alignment between the Triple Billion and SDGs enables countries to apply Triple Billion targets in delivering their commitments on the SDGs., Triple Billion projections were calculated for the years – relative to a baseline providing much- needed milestones for progress made at the global  regional and country levels in providing promoting and protecting global health., This chapter focuses on the global and regional results to date  ., Overall the world has collectively achieved the healthier population billion target but is lagging on the other two

improve population health and well-being by promoting healthier behaviours lifestyles and environments., Achieving this billion relies on multisectoral intervention through advocacy and changes in public policy and regulation., The calculation of this billion comprised tracer indicators including four disaggregated indicators that cover a wide range of health topics including clean air safe water road safety tobacco and alcohol consumption obesity violence child nutrition and development., Overall the world has been progressing steadily towards the HPOP billion target since ., This

achieve the health- related SDG targets by  which is vital for building healthier more equitable and prosperous societies globally., For such efforts timely and accurate monitoring of the progress based on robust data is vital for effective policy changes and interventions., However lack of timely reporting and delay in producing health estimates using the most recent empirical data could bring great challenges in delivering accurate assessment for many health outcomes., Figure . shows the percentage of UHC service coverage index tracers for which primary data were available for years –., It is evident that most indicators suffered from a data shortage at various degrees across countries., A lot could be done to enhance the data input for the Triple Billion computation., More often than not the lack of data will not be limited to the data required by the Triple Billion rather it is deeply entrenched in poorly performing health information systems., Thus efforts should be made to strengthen the general health information systems in countries to generate reliable data for the effective tracking of and policy changes regarding health-related SDGs., WHO is committed to work with Member States to strengthen their system capacity to collect analyse and use health data., Various tools have been developed by WHO to enhance countries’ data capacity., For example  the WHO SCORE for health data technical package was designed to assess the performance of national health information systems identify the data gaps and provide a toolbox to improve various areas of a functioning health information system  ., The Data management competency framework DMCF developed by the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific is another example of such a tool it enables health information managers to identify capacity gaps and drive competency development at various levels Box . ., World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals Figure ., Percentage of UHC service coverage index tracers for which primary data were available for years  – Source  WHO and World Bank  ., Strategic and integrated capacity-building of the health information workforce in the Western Pacific Region Strategic use of data for decision-making is critical for measuring and driving progress towards global and national health indicator targets., Capacity limitations of health information workers HIW often hinder the ability to effectively produce and use health data despite significant improvements in health information systems., HIWs often do not possess the required capacities to participate consistently and in a timely manner in the data management cycle., To systematically assess such capacity gaps the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific with support from WHO headquarters country offices and in collaboration with partner organizations launched the DMCF in May   ., This framework is a comprehensive integrated and coherent tool that can be used to define and assess current and future competency needs of HIWs across the region and beyond., This tool will enable health information managers in countries to identify capacity gaps and plan and drive the competency development of their HIWs across different levels of their health system., Papua New Guinea has set out a clear path as the first country to adopt the framework., As a direct outcome of a national health information workshop held in October  Papua New Guinea National Department of Health collaborated with WHO to establish a standardized set of competencies required for health information positions at both national and provincial levels based on the ideally required skills and competencies spelled out in the WHO DMCF., These competency profiles are invaluable as they provide a clear foundation for developing tools to assess training needs and formulating comprehensive long-term capacity-building strategies., The national data management competency profiles were officially launched together with the Provincial Health Authority Monitoring & Evaluation toolkit in September ., China followed suit by identifying the framework’s value in improving health information workforce capacity in a systematic and sustainable manner., The Center for Health Statistics and Information of the National Health Commission of China collaborated with WHO in translating the framework into Chinese and conducted a series of workshops at both national and provincial levels in preparation for conducting competency gap assessments among different types of health workers across different provinces., The adoption of the framework in Papua New Guinea and China serves as pivotal examples highlighting how the WHO DMCF could be applied to each Member State’s unique context., This ability to contextualize and apply the framework is essential given the diverse nature of Member States’ health information systems and their diverse priorities and needs in addressing both present and future health challenges., Progress towards WHO Triple Billion targets ., Conclusion The WHO Triple Billion is a framework and a strategy aiming to drive timely improvement of global health., The targets although set at the global level were simply the aggregation of country-level estimates that were calculated based on underlying tracer indicators., The Triple Billion projections provide WHO its Member States and partners with the much-needed assessment of progress towards fulfilling their commitment on Triple Billion targets and the health-related SDGs., Tracer indicators are the cornerstone of the Triple Billion targets but also a critical tool for countries to identify and prioritize strategies to enhance the health of their populations., By examining the projected contributions at indicator level policy-makers can make informed course adjustments to achieve the SDGs set by the global community., As the GPW is drawing to a close in  continuous tracking of the Triple Billion targets and a proper transition from GPW to GPW is vital for WHO to ensure accountability adaptability and efficiency in achieving the ambitious goals it set jointly with its Member States., All three levels of WHO – headquarters regional and country offices – should make every effort to align their priorities., Through these priorities that will be reflected in the new programmatic and outcome indicators for the upcoming GPW WHO will reaffirm its commitment to address evolving global health needs enhance collaboration with stakeholders and strengthen its role in advancing global health equity and security., Committed investment in improving data and health information systems across the globe will be essential for such endeavours., Thirteenth general programme of work – promote health keep the world safe serve the vulnerable., Geneva World Health Organization  WHO PRP .  , https   iris.who.int handle   .,

health issues such as the double burden of malnutrition where undernutrition coexists in parallel with overweight and obesity globally., It also highlights the health challenges faced by persons with disabilities and refugees and international migrants.., The double burden of malnutrition Combating malnutrition in all its forms is one of the greatest global health challenges., Today the world faces the double burden of malnutrition characterized by the coexistence of undernutrition along with overweight and obesity within individuals households and populations  and across the life course., This section highlights the global and regional trends in the population-level burden of stunting wasting and overweight among children under  years of age and the double burden of thinness or underweight and obesity among older children adolescents and adults., Box . summarizes the definitions of the indicators of malnutrition used in this section., Child stunting stems from poor nutrition during pregnancy and early childhood., It can lead to severe physical and cognitive damage that may last a lifetime., A child who is moderately or severely wasted due to recent rapid weight loss or a failure to gain weight has an increased risk of death., In contrast a child may be overweight due to excessive caloric intake which may be due to poor access to nutritious foods consumption of nutrient-poor ultra-processed foods and or inadequate physical activity., In childhood and adolescence obesity is associated with greater risks and earlier onset of various NCDs such as type diabetes and cardiovascular disease., In addition children and teenagers living with obesity may experience psychosocial consequences from stigma discrimination and bullying., Undernutrition as measured by thinness among children aged – years lowers learning potential weakens the immune system and increases the risk of morbidity and mortality., Micronutrient deficiencies and anaemia in adolescent girls amplify the risk of life-threatening complications during pregnancy and childbirth., In adults obesity is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality from a variety of NCDs such as cardiovascular diseases diabetes cancers neurological disorders chronic respiratory diseases and digestive disorders., Undernutrition in adults as captured by the underweight indicator is critical for adult women during pregnancy with repercussions for both mother and child., In older adults undernutrition can lead to increased risk of impaired immune response and physical and cognitive impairment., In turn ageing brings physiological changes with sensory impairment poor oral health isolation loneliness and depression which further exacerbate the risk of undernutrition., Definitions of metrics and measures used in this section For children under  years of age • Stunting height-for-age lower than standard deviations below WHO Child Growth Standards median • Wasting

Sustainable Development Goals .., The magnitude of the problem In  an estimated  million UI – million  children under  years of age globally were affected by stunting too short for age and  million UI – million were affected by wasting too thin for height  revealing the vast extent of undernutrition among the youngest population., However an estimated  million  UI – million children under  years of age were overweight in  ., In the same year among older children and adolescents aged – years an estimated  million UI – million were living with thinness while  million  UI – million were living with obesity., Among adults aged years and older an estimated  million were underweight while  million were living with obesity., This means that over one billion people aged  years and older worldwide are living with obesity while over half a billion others are living with underweight or thinness  ., These numbers along with the health implications described above indicate that the world is dealing with a public health problem not only at a massive scale but also a complex one..., Stunting wasting and overweight among children under  years of age Undernutrition among children under  years of age globally as reflected by the number affected by stunting and wasting has declined in the past three decades., The number affected by stunting declined from  million UI – million in to  million  UI –

trends in global health At this pace of change the world is off-track to meet the global targets to halve the number of children under  years of age affected by stunting from the  baseline and to reduce the prevalence of wasting and overweight to less than %   ., Almost all WHO regions are experiencing a considerable burden of both undernutrition in the form of stunting and wasting and overweight among the youngest population., In the South-East Asia Region the prevalence of overweight nearly doubled in the past three decades  reaching .%, in  while the prevalence of wasting continued to be the highest across all WHO regions despite having declined from .% UI .–.%, This means that in almost one in five .% children in this region were either too thin or too heavy for their height., In addition three out of  .%, children were affected by stunting even though its prevalence had halved since when it stood at .% UI .–.%  , Fig. .  ., In the Eastern Mediterranean Region approximately the same proportion of children were affected by wasting .%, in  while a quarter .%, UI .–.% of all children under  years of age were affected by stunting., The Region of the Americas had the highest prevalence of overweight .%, across all WHO regions in  and very low prevalence of wasting .%, However about one in  .%, children in this region were affected by stunting that year  Fig. . ., Peru is notable both regionally and globally for a massive reduction in stunting prevalence Box .  ., A dramatic reduction in childhood stunting in Peru Since  few countries have reduced the prevalence of stunting among children under years of age as dramatically as Peru., It is estimated to have declined from a very high prevalence of .% UI .–.%, in  to .%, in  which is considered a medium prevalence., The ARR .% per year substantially surpasses that in the Region of the Americas .%, per year as well as in the upper-middle-income countries .%, per year  Fig. .   ., An analysis of drivers of the decline in stunting prevalence in Peru from to identified multiple determinants of stunting reduction including socioeconomic class parental education parental health and differences in maternal and newborn health care., Reducing the equity gap contributed greatly to this reduction  with the greatest reductions observed in the lowest wealth quintile in rural areas and among children with the least-educated mothers., The slope index of inequality a measure of absolute wealth-related inequality indicates that the gap in stunting prevalence among children under years of age between the richest and poorest households reduced by half between and  leading to greater equity., Peru’s experience offers useful lessons in tackling the problem of stunting with the participation of

The Western Pacific Region also experienced a large increase in the double burden as the obesity prevalence increased almost tenfold to reach .%, in  largely overtaking the dominance of thinness., The South-East Asia Region was the only region where the double burden decreased as thinness prevalence fell sharply from .% UI .–.%, however the region continued to have the highest thinness prevalence

age-standardized prevalence of underweight and obesity among adults aged  years and older increased from .% in to .% in ., This increase has been driven by the rise in obesity the age-standardized prevalence of which more than doubled from .% UI .–.%, The age-standardized prevalence of underweight halved in the same period from .% UI  .–.%, This means that obesity has taken over the dominance in the double burden of malnutrition among adults globally in the past three decades Fig. .  , .Obesity prevalence among adults aged years and older increased in all WHO regions., The Region of the Americas and the Eastern Mediterranean Region have experienced the largest absolute increase in obesity prevalence since  leading to the highest obesity prevalence across WHO regions in  affecting one third of adults in the Region of the Americas and almost three in in the Eastern Mediterranean Region., In the European Region the ., percentage point increase in the double burden was due entirely to the rise in obesity prevalence as thinness prevalence remained low., About half of the double burden in the African Region was due to obesity in  up from about one fifth in ., The Western Pacific Region remained the region with the lowest combined prevalence of underweight and obesity among adults but obesity is becoming dominant., Underweight prevalence decreased markedly in the South-East

coexistence of undernutrition overweight and obesity can be addressed by taking advantage of the shared drivers across forms of malnutrition including biological environmental and social factors to design and implement policies and programmes using a life- course multi-generational approach., These double- duty actions are evidence-based efficient and effective interventions that can make the most of often limited time fiscal and human resources., Common delivery platforms that can be leveraged for double-duty actions include national dietary guidelines health systems urban food systems humanitarian settings and social policies – ., Double-duty actions need not necessarily be new actions., Rather policy-makers can capitalize on existing government buy-in and resources by reviewing and refocusing existing food and agriculture policies., They often already exist to address single forms of malnutrition but need to be refocused to address multiple forms simultaneously., Strong opportunities for double-duty actions include the following examples school feeding programmes that focus only on addressing undernutrition or overweight can be redesigned to ensure that they instead provide and promote a healthy diet scaling up the WHO antenatal care recommendations protecting and promoting breastfeeding revising complementary feeding guidelines and educating care-givers on the risks of unhealthy complementary foods designing social support and welfare programmes to reduce risks from unhealthy foods and ensuring that food systems and food environment policies facilitate the purchase and consumption of a healthy diet by increasing access to and attractiveness of nutritious foods., Nutrition and food safety are closely interlinked and essential for achieving positive health outcomes from food systems., There is a linkage between subclinical infection with enteropathogens and stunting   ., Food must be safe available accessible nutritious  culturally acceptable and ingested regularly to ensure growth health and well-being., Unsafe food increases infection and intoxication creating a vicious cycle of disease malnutrition and disability particularly affecting vulnerable groups. ., Disability-related health inequities Disability results from the interaction between health conditions and or impairments that a person experiences such as dementia blindness or spinal cord injury and a range of contextual factors related to different environmental and personal factors including societal attitudes access to infrastructure discriminatory policies  poverty age and gender., This understanding of disability is grounded in the WHO International classification of functioning disability and health ICF  published in  ., According to the WHO Global report on health equity for persons with disabilities  approximately . billion persons in – about % of the global population – had disability., The global number of persons with disabilities has increased substantially in the past decade due to demographic and epidemiological changes such as population growth and the increase in the number of persons with NCDs who are living longer and ageing with limitations in functioning  ., Persons with disabilities often experience health inequities due to avoidable unjust and unfair conditions., They die younger have poorer health and increased disease risk and more limitations in their everyday functioning., The contributing factors to these inequities can be i health-system-related factors such as barriers in physical infrastructure and communication negative attitudes by health workers or lack of disability data in the health information system  ii structural factors such as stigma and discrimination  iii social determinants such as poverty and lack of education and iv disease risk factors such as tobacco consumption and obesity., World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals .., Premature mortality among persons with disabilities Data on health inequities in terms of premature mortality among persons with disabilities are scarce., However a growing body of evidence indicates that persons with disabilities have higher rates of premature mortality compared with persons without disabilities  ., A systematic review of studies from low- and middle- income countries found that persons with disabilities have double the mortality rates of persons without disabilities  ., Premature mortality is even more visible in those that are most marginalized among persons with disabilities., For example evidence from some high-income European countries shows that persons with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities have higher risks of premature mortality compared with the general population – ., The COVID- pandemic exacerbated this pattern., A systematic review of studies found that persons with disabilities were almost three times as likely to die from COVID- than persons without disabilities  ..., Poorer health and higher disease risk among persons with disabilities Persons with disabilities have in general poorer health and higher risk of developing secondary health conditions  ., Data from across European countries collected via the European Health Interview Survey in show that overall compared with persons without disability persons with severe disability are more likely to report having NCDs including chronic respiratory diseases over eight times as likely  coronary heart disease or angina pectoris  times as likely  stroke  times as likely  diabetes almost six times as likely  and depression over eight times as likely ., The gap in the self-reported morbidity between persons with and without disability varies greatly across the European

 ., Key issues and trends in global health .., Contributing factors to health inequities among persons with disabilities There is a range of contributing factors within and beyond the health system that drive premature mortality and increased morbidity among persons with disabilities., In terms of health-system factors lack of accessible and inclusive health service provision often leaves persons with disabilities behind., A systematic review of  studies from eight high-income countries found that women with disabilities are % less likely to have been screened for breast cancer and % less likely to have been screened for cervical cancer than their non-disabled peers  ., Data from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in countries show that children with disabilities are generally at greater risk of missing out on vaccinations  only % of children aged – months with more  than one functional difficulty are fully vaccinated compared with % of children at the same age without disabilities  ., Evidence from countries shows that persons with disabilities have lower access to health services than those without disabilities Fig. . ., Across these countries the median estimate shows that persons with disabilities are more than four times as likely as persons without disabilities to be unable to get health care when they need it % of persons with disabilities versus % of persons without disabilities indicated that they needed but could not get health care., In eight countries more than % of persons with disabilities were not able to get health care when they needed it   ., In European countries costs of services geographical location and long waiting lists which disproportionately affect persons with disabilities are major factors in the lower access to health services., Beyond health-system factors persons with disabilities are also more likely to have risk factors for ill health., Data from European countries show that compared with persons without disabilities persons with severe disabilities are overall three times as likely to self-report having high blood pressure twice as likely to be obese and a third as likely to do regular aerobic physical activity Fig. .  ., Very often the reason for the higher risk factor presence in persons with disabilities is the lack of accessible health promotion and prevention strategies which do not allow this population to benefit equally  ., Different social determinants also play an important role as factors that drive health inequities among persons with disabilities., Poverty is a solid example to demonstrate this., Poor living conditions and social exclusion add to the risk of poor health and unmet health-care needs among persons with disabilities., Across European countries .% of persons with severe disabilities were at risk of poverty before social transfers  such as benefits allowances and pensions  compared with .% of persons with no disability., Yet even after social transfers poverty risk is still double among persons with disabilities .%, compared with .%  Fig. . ., In nine countries there was little or no disability-related inequity in poverty risk ≤

Source Authors’ analysis of data from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions and WHO Model Disability Survey –   ., World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals Poverty affects the state of health of persons with disabilities – through inability to afford health-related expenses overcrowded and poor living conditions that contribute to the spread of diseases poor mental health and social exclusion among other factors., According to the analysis from European countries persons with severe disability are overall twice as likely to report having unmet health-care needs due to financial limitations than persons with no disability., They are also almost twice as likely to be unable to meet unexpected financial expenses e.g. having surgery or repairing their house  more likely to be overburdened by housing costs and four times as likely to be living in conditions with  SDG indicator ..., See section .. for global

health Box ., Intimate partner violence against women with disabilities A systematic review of studies mainly from high-income countries concluded that the prevalence of all forms of IPV including physical psychological emotional sexual and financial was higher among women with disabilities than among women without disabilities  ., Evidence is also emerging from low- and middle-income countries., For example analysis of data from seven violence-prevention programmes in low- and middle-income countries indicated that women with disabilities were nearly twice as likely to report past--month IPV than women without disabilities  ., Current estimates are likely significant underestimates as women with disabilities tend to be underrepresented in surveys and may also experience disability-specific types of violence that are often unmeasured., For a better understanding of the risk factors for violence against women and to enable the development of more specialized prevention strategies and response plans it is necessary to improve the inclusion of women with disabilities and the issue of disability within violence against women in population-based surveys and research., WHO recently issued recommendations for good practice in measuring violence against women with disabilities  . .., Towards disability- inclusive and data- informed health systems, The way forward to achieve inclusive health systems and leave no one behind includes a systems-level response through strengthening health systems that integrates targeted actions to advance health equity for persons with disabilities., It is essential that the actions that governments take to advance disability inclusion in the health sector are informed by valid and reliable data that allow monitoring and tracking progress., As shown above however data on health inequities among persons with disabilities are scarce., Factors contributing to the inequity are frequently not well captured making it difficult sometimes to explore the drivers of the differences and whether these differences are indeed due to unjust or unfair factors., The collection of data on disability is often deprioritized in many countries consequently the evidence of health inequities and their contributing factors is more limited than for other groups in marginalized situations., However lack of evidence should not be interpreted as a lack of inequities., There is a fundamental need to collect or disaggregate population- and facility-based data based on disability status across the different levels of country health information systems., For example at input level administrative sources such as financial tracking systems databases and records on human resources infrastructure or policies can be used to understand how financing for disability works or whether health facilities are accessible., At output level facility assessments or facility reporting systems can measure availability of services service readiness or quality., At outcome and impact level disability-specific surveys or routine health and demographic surveys that allow disaggregation of data by disability and integrating disability indicators in facility-level data collection can facilitate in-depth understanding of the experiences of persons with disabilities in terms of health-care needs and coverage., Chile is among the countries that have implemented the WHO Model Disability Survey to inform policy Box . ., Only through valid and reliable data on disability will countries be able to develop evidenced-based policies to monitor the SDGs to measure progress towards national targets such as UHC and to take stock of the challenges that remain., World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals Box ., The role of data in improving the lives of persons with disability in Chile The Model Disability Survey MDS  developed by WHO and the World Bank in  addresses the scarcity of data and often poor quality of information on persons with disabilities in many countries  ., The survey takes a broader approach to disability collecting data on functioning and environmental barriers and facilitators., WHO has been supporting the successful implementation of the MDS in more than countries to date providing a comprehensive assessment of the situation of persons with disabilities and contributing to better public policy., Under the leadership of the Ministry of Social Development and Family and the National Disability Service  SENADIS  with participation from the Ministry of Health the WHO MDS was implemented in Chile for the first time in   ., Preparation of the survey took more than a year including consultation with persons with disabilities civil society groups their families and supporters across all regions of the country., The survey found that one in six .% people aged  years and older in Chile had disabilities in  .% of adults and .% of children aged – years ., An estimated % of adults with disability had a mental or behavioural disorder., It also identified barriers that persons with disability experienced including in health and transport  ., The findings informed the development of key legislation plans and actions to address the identified barriers., For example Law ., on labour inclusion was implemented setting a labour quota of % for workers with disabilities that all companies with more than workers must meet – with plans dedicated to gradually increase this percentage., Furthermore the results of the study helped design protocols and methodologies to improve the level of participation of persons with disabilities such as the national census that incorporated a protocol to interview persons with disabilities in their homes., In addition the development of the National Mental Health Action Plan which was launched in  and the National Disability Qualification and Certification Plan., More actions were taken towards improving access to health services among persons with disabilities., In addition a decision was taken to include disability questions in the country’s National Health Survey to enable the government to better track progress and understand unmet service needs among persons with disabilities., In line with the WHO recommendation to undertake the MDS every – years to track progress on the situations of persons with disabilities and dependency Chile implemented the survey for a second time in   ., The results of the new assessment will help the Government of Chile better understand the impact of disability-related policies and actions that the country has taken and plan next steps towards addressing the needs of persons with disabilities and to monitor the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. ., Health of refugees and migrants The number of international migrants increased from  million .% of the global population in  to  million .% of the global population in   ., This number does not include internal migrants  which were estimated to be around  million in   ., In addition in mid- an estimated  million people were forcibly displaced including those who are internally displaced refugees and asylum seekers  ., Migration could either improve or degrade an individual’s health status., Refugees and migrants often face worse health outcomes in countries of transit and destination due to barriers such as language and cultural differences institutional discrimination and restricted use of health services., The first WHO World report on the health of refugees and migrants released in  offers an overview of the health of refugees and international migrants along with the associated determinants and public health challenges while also revealing crucial gaps in global data and knowledge  ., Prioritizing the rights of refugees and migrants to timely affordable and dignified health care is essential for achieving health equity., Key issues and trends in global health .., Key issues affecting the health of refugees and migrants Some flows of global migration can be predicted by factors such as economic growth and demographic changes., However displacements due to emergencies arising from disease outbreaks conflicts natural disasters and climate change pose significant challenges., Health and social protection systems need to be prepared for sudden upheaval of populations., New and renewed emergencies are straining health services in all WHO regions., In addition to deaths and injuries the risks of infectious diseases and mental health conditions also increase meanwhile health facilities may be unable to cope as they are heavily affected by power and supply outages or even targeted in conflicts., The threat of malnutrition and starvation exists further down the line as a result of disrupted food supplies  exacerbating critical health needs of already vulnerable populations  ., Although a large proportion of refugees and migrants are in generally good health their numbers also include children elderly people persons with disabilities and those whose health has been negatively impacted by their travels or the circumstances in their home country., Some might start a family get sick or get injured in their host country., These health needs transcend national boundaries but many countries restrict health coverage based on immigration status limiting access to health insurance and services and the cost of non-emergency care may be an unaffordable out-of-pocket expense., These factors leave millions in vulnerable situations globally and they may encounter poorer health outcomes particularly in substandard living and working conditions  ., For instance studies have found higher rates of anaemia in women and children among refugees and migrants compared with local populations and there is an increased risk of both anaemia and malnutrition in some camp-based settings – ., Migrant workers may face discrimination exploitation limited workplace rights and social protection as well as significant occupational health problems such as higher risk of occupational injuries documented particularly among male migrant workers employed in high-risk industries – ., During the COVID- pandemic migrant workers in some countries particularly those in low-skilled roles faced heightened exposure risks due to overcrowded living conditions – ., Those who were employed in essential sectors such as health care and agriculture bore a disproportionate burden of pandemic-related challenges  – ., In addition refugees and migrants may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of AMR during various phases of migration and displacement due to factors such as exposure to infections limited access to diagnostics and therapeutics and inappropriate use of antibiotics  ., Distribution of access to government health services for refugees and migrants across  countries –      Access to all services regardless of migration status Access to all services dependent on migration status Access to emergency health- care services only No access to any health services Proportion of countries % Source  WHO   based on unpublished data from the International Organization for Migration., World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals Yet data on health-care access policies from  countries between and show that only half of them provide refugees and migrants with access to all government-funded health services under the same conditions as nationals regardless of migratory status  see Fig. .  ., Available evidence reveals mixed patterns of NCD burden and risks among migrants and refugees compared with host populations., Taking cancer as an example studies from three high-income countries in the Americas suggested better outcomes for migrants with cancer  whereas research from two high-income European countries indicated that cancer was often diagnosed at advanced stages among refugee and migrant populations leading to poorer health outcomes than host populations – ., Studies from three African countries underscored gaps in cervical cancer awareness among refugee and migrant women stressing the importance of prevention and early detection

social deprivation defined as not being able to afford certain goods services and social activities  twice as likely to be overburdened by housing costs as a portion of their income and ., times as

values indicator a higher indicator estimate among non-migrants., A difference of zero indicates no inequality., The indicators are based on self-reported chronic conditions or risk factors in the months prior to the survey., Source Authors’ analysis of data from the European Health Interview Survey and the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions –    ., Patterns of inequality in NCD burden and risk factors between migrants and non-migrants varied greatly across European countries reflecting the multifaceted influence of genetic social environmental and other factors that contribute to NCD burden Fig. . ., For example the proportion of people reporting a long-standing illness or health problem is more than  percentage points higher among migrants compared with non-migrants in seven countries but is more than  percentage points higher among non-migrants in six other countries., Reported high blood pressure prevalence is more than  percentage points higher among migrant populations in three countries but is more than  percentage points higher among non-migrant populations in seven other countries   .Similarly inequalities in the prevalence of NCD risk factors varied across countries., For example the prevalence of tobacco smoking was over  percentage points higher among migrants in four countries but over  percentage points higher among non-migrants in six countries., In eight countries reported overweight prevalence was at least  percentage points higher among migrant populations  while it was also at least  percentage points higher among non-migrant populations in eight countries   ., Therefore inequalities in NCDs between migrants and non-migrants vary significantly across European countries  underscoring the imperative for tailored country-specific investigations into health inequalities and their drivers to inform equity-oriented policies and programmes., World health statistics  monitoring health for the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals .., The need for quality data on refugee and migrant health There is a lack of timely representative and systematically collected disaggregated data on refugee and migrant health in national health information systems., This makes it challenging to understand and address their health needs develop inclusive public health approaches and track progress towards national and global health goals., Data-driven approaches are vital for fostering health equity and social inclusion., Box . shows how mixed-methods data generation provides insights into the health status and needs of refugees from Ukraine in Poland., Recognizing the urgency the WHO Global Action Plan on promoting the health of refugees and migrants emphasizes the collection of high-quality disaggregated data to monitor progress towards implementation of the six priority areas  ., Since the Global Action Plan is founded on health issues for refugees and migrants such data and the resulting monitoring will also contribute to the health-related SDGs for the population on the move  in particular refugees and migrants worldwide., specifically commits to enhancing capacity-building support for countries to significantly increase the availability of high-quality data disaggregated by migratory status., Mixed-methods data-generation approach provides insights into health status and needs of refugees from Ukraine in Poland The outbreak of war in Ukraine in led to an immediate and unprecedented influx of millions of refugees fleeing from Ukraine to other countries in Europe and beyond with Poland hosting up to ., million refugees at the height of the crisis., In response to the urgent need for evidence on the health status and needs of refugees Statistics Poland collaborated closely with WHO at country regional and headquarters levels., A mixed-methods approach was adopted in the border provinces of Poland through a representative household survey and behavioural insights research initiated in  and repeated in ., With the country’s population surging by over % the Polish authorities prioritized understanding the health needs of the refugees., The results are illustrated in Fig. .  ., Even though services were rapidly made available for them the European Union directive that allowed such provision does not necessarily address barriers to access
